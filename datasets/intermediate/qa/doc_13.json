    "question": "How sensitive is the case for open borders to negative impacts on productivity?",
    "answer": "The case for open borders appears remarkably robust even when assuming substantial negative impacts on productivity. Even with an extreme immigration-TFP elasticity of -3 (which would imply UK income per capita would be 64% higher today had there been no immigration in recent decades - an implausible claim), the model shows the UK population would still reach 2.6 billion under open borders. When testing different TFP elasticities ranging from highly negative (-3) to highly positive (+5), we see that the maximum population varies from 2.61 billion to 6.8 billion, but significant migration occurs in all scenarios. This suggests that even if one believes immigration has strong negative effects on productivity, the economic forces driving migration under open borders remain powerful enough to generate substantial population movements. The model also indicates that if population growth itself negatively impacts TFP, this would simply spread the population growth over a longer timeframe rather than fundamentally alter the equilibrium outcome."

    "question": "What happens to remittance flows under large-scale migration?",
    "answer": "Remittance flows follow a proportional decline pattern as migration increases. Specifically, they decrease from a maximum level of 15% of income in proportion to the remaining population in the origin country. This occurs because migrants don't send money to random recipients, but rather to their family members. Since migrating individuals are assumed to be representative of their origin country's population, the proportion of their family remaining in the origin country will match the overall population distribution. As more people leave, there are fewer remaining family members to send remittances to, creating a natural declining pattern in remittance flows. Children of migrants are assumed to send no remittances at all, further contributing to this decline over generations."

    "question": "How does the inclusion of capital stock dynamics affect migration patterns compared to simpler models?",
    "answer": "The inclusion of capital stock dynamics through the Solow model creates a more nuanced and gradual migration pattern compared to simpler models. Rather than seeing an instant surge of immigrants, the movement of people is moderated by two key mechanisms: First, immigration creates a negative shock to capital per worker in rich countries while simultaneously producing a positive shock to capital per worker in developing countries. Second, remittance flows back to developing countries boost their capital stock in the short run. These capital dynamics act as natural brakes on migration speed, making the process more gradual than in models that ignore capital effects.\n\nImportantly, even with these moderating factors and the conservative assumption of completely immobile capital between countries, the fundamental \"tsunami invariant\" - that massive migration will still occur under open borders - remains robust. This holds true even when combining capital dynamics with substantial negative productivity effects, as demonstrated in the various scenarios modeled with different TFP elasticities.\n\nThese capital dynamics represent a more realistic modeling approach than previous simplifying assumptions, though they don't fundamentally alter the core conclusion about large-scale migration under open borders."

    "question": "What would be the long-term population equilibrium under open borders when accounting for economic factors?",
    "answer": "The long-term population equilibrium under open borders varies significantly depending on the assumed total factor productivity (TFP) elasticity with respect to immigration. Our modeling shows that even with highly pessimistic assumptions about immigration's effect on productivity, the UK would reach a substantial population equilibrium. With a strongly negative TFP elasticity of -3, the maximum population would be 2.61 billion; with a positive TFP elasticity of +5, it could reach 6.8 billion. Notably, the phenomenon appears robust - even assuming substantial negative productivity impacts from immigration, significant population increases would occur due to the economic incentives for migration. However, these estimates should be taken with some caution, as the model has important limitations, particularly in not accounting for productivity effects in origin countries and lacking convergence mechanisms for currently low-income countries. A more complete analysis incorporating these factors, along with innovation and fertility effects, will be needed for more definitive equilibrium estimates."

    "question": "How do different assumptions about productivity effects of immigration change the migration outcomes?",
    "answer": "The striking finding is that even extreme assumptions about productivity effects don't fundamentally alter the tsunami-like migration patterns - they mainly affect the ultimate population equilibrium. With highly negative productivity elasticity (-3), where immigration substantially reduces total factor productivity, the UK still reaches a massive 2.61 billion people. With positive elasticity (+5), where immigration boosts productivity, the equilibrium population rises to 6.8 billion.\n\nWhat's particularly notable is that the case for open borders appears robust even under very pessimistic productivity assumptions. Someone would need to argue that historical UK income would be 64% higher without any immigration to justify an elasticity of -3, which seems implausible. The key dynamic is that even large negative productivity effects are outweighed by the massive income differentials driving migration.\n\nThe main impact of different productivity assumptions is on the timing and ultimate scale of migration rather than whether large-scale movement occurs. More positive productivity effects lead to faster initial migration and higher equilibrium populations, while negative effects spread the movement over a longer period and result in lower but still massive population levels.\n\nOf course, these results should be considered preliminary given the model's limitations around origin country effects and convergence mechanisms, which will need to be addressed in future work."

    "question": "What role does the Solow model play in understanding migration dynamics?",
    "answer": "The Solow model serves as a crucial mechanism for understanding how capital, labor, and productivity interact during mass migration. In our analysis, we use it to move beyond simplistic assumptions about immediate population transfers by incorporating the relationship between income, productivity, labor, and capital. Most importantly, the Solow model helps explain why immigration wouldn't occur as an instant surge - the negative shock to capital per worker in rich countries and positive shock to capital per worker in developing countries creates a natural moderating effect on migration flows.\n\nWe make the conservative assumption that capital is entirely immobile between countries, which actually exaggerates the short-run income changes that would result from labor reallocation. This helps us understand how capital-labor ratios affect migration patterns over time, rather than assuming instantaneous population transfers.\n\nThe Solow framework allows us to dispose of cruder assumptions (like immigrants transferring half their low productivity) in favor of a more sophisticated understanding of how remittances and capital stock changes influence migration dynamics. However, we should note that our implementation still has limitations, particularly in not modeling productivity convergence between countries over time, which may overestimate long-run migration flows."

    "question": "How do endogenous capital stocks affect the speed of migration under open borders?",
    "answer": "The inclusion of endogenous capital stocks through the Solow model actually serves to moderate the speed of migration under open borders, particularly in the short run. As immigrants move to wealthy nations, they create a negative shock to capital per worker in rich countries while simultaneously generating a positive shock to capital per worker in developing countries. This dynamic, combined with the assumption of completely immobile capital between countries, prevents immigration from occurring as an instant surge.\n\nFurthermore, remittance flows back to developing countries boost the capital stock in those regions in the short run, which also helps to spread out the migration process over time. This is a more realistic model than previous versions that made simplifying assumptions about capital stocks, as it captures the natural economic forces that would tend to smooth out population movements rather than allowing for instantaneous mass migration.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that even with these moderating effects from endogenous capital stocks, the model still shows substantial long-term population movements, ranging from 2.6 billion to 6.8 billion depending on productivity assumptions."

    "question": "What would be the impact of open borders when considering both remittances and capital effects?",
    "answer": "The inclusion of remittances and capital effects actually demonstrates that open borders would still lead to substantial migration, though the path would be more gradual than in simpler models. Remittances (assumed at 15% of income, declining with origin country population) and immobile capital stocks act as equilibrating mechanisms that prevent an instant population surge. \n\nThe negative shock to capital per worker in rich countries and positive shock in developing countries, combined with remittance flows boosting capital stock in origin countries, help spread out the migration over time. Even under very conservative assumptions about total factor productivity (TFP) impacts, including scenarios where immigration has strong negative effects on productivity (elasticity of -3), the UK would still reach a population of 2.6 billion. This suggests the case for open borders is quite robust - even someone claiming dramatically negative productivity effects would need to argue that the UK's per capita income would be 64% higher today without historical immigration for the model's implications to be invalidated.\n\nThe key finding is that while these economic mechanisms moderate the speed of population movements, they don't fundamentally alter the long-run equilibrium under open borders. This holds true across a range of assumptions about immigration's impact on productivity, with maximum UK populations ranging from 2.61 billion to 6.8 billion depending on the TFP elasticity used."
