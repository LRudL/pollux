    "question": "How does considering population as endogenous (rather than exogenous) change our assessment of population subsidies?",
    "answer": "Endogenizing population dramatically increases the estimated value of population subsidies compared to my previous analysis. The key finding is that when we account for how fertility responds to economic growth, the marginal benefits become effectively infinite under any reasonable discount rate.\n\nFor non-longtermist perspectives using traditional discount rates (2.5-7.5%), even when we artificially cut off benefits beyond the year 2300, the marginal value of an additional birth ranges from 55% to 3300% of global annual production. These values are substantially higher than my previous estimates, particularly for higher discount rates.\n\nThe effect is even more extreme when we consider that implementing such subsidies would increase population by a non-infinitesimal amount, which in turn would make the marginal benefit of each additional person even larger. This creates a powerful positive feedback loop.\n\nFor longtermist perspectives (those with zero discount rate), the optimal subsidy becomes literally infinite, as income eventually grows faster than any constant discount rate over an infinite timeframe.\n\nThese findings suggest my previous estimates of optimal population subsidies ($210,000 under a 7% discount rate, or $1,200,000 under a 5% discount rate) were actually too conservative, particularly when considering longer time horizons or lower discount rates."

    "question": "What's the relationship between income and fertility rates - is it simply linear or more complex?",
    "answer": "The relationship between income and fertility rates is more complex than a simple linear decline. Looking at the data, when we plot the natural logs of live births per woman against GDP per capita, we find that a quadratic model fits better than either a linear or cubic relationship. This creates what we can call a \"tick-shaped\" curve, where fertility initially decreases with rising income but then begins to increase again at very high income levels. Specifically, we identified a minimum fertility rate occurring at around $86,838 in income, after which fertility actually increases with further income growth. This pattern is consistent with other research that has found similar relationships when using HDI instead of income, and we observe that very high-income individuals now tend to have more children than middle-class individuals. The quadratic model not only provides a better goodness of fit but also maintains excellent p-values in our regression analysis."

    "question": "How should we think about the value of additional births when considering infinite time horizons?",
    "answer": "When considering infinite time horizons, we must distinguish between longtermist and non-longtermist perspectives. For longtermists who favor a zero discount rate, the marginal benefit of an additional birth is literally infinite, as income eventually grows faster than any discount rate. This leads to the conclusion that the optimal subsidy for additional births should be as high as possible.\n\nFor non-longtermists who apply positive discount rates, while the theoretical value isn't infinite, it's effectively infinite from a practical policy perspective. Even with higher discount rates like 5% or 7%, and when artificially capping the time horizon (e.g., to 2300), the present value of the technological externalities from additional births reaches levels that exceed what governments could reasonably spend - ranging from 55% to over 3300% of global annual production.\n\nImportantly, these benefits increase rapidly with population growth, creating a powerful feedback loop where each additional birth makes subsequent births even more valuable. This suggests that our current approach to population policy may be drastically undervaluing the benefits of additional people, particularly when considering their contributions to technological progress over long time horizons."

  {
    "question": "How do different discount rates affect the assessment of population benefits?",
    "answer": "Different discount rates dramatically alter the assessment of population benefits, with lower rates leading to substantially higher valuations. At a 2.5% discount rate (roughly equivalent to zero pure time preference under current global conditions), the marginal benefits become extremely large. For higher discount rates like 5% and 7%, the benefits are still substantial but more bounded.\n\nThe most striking finding is that as income eventually grows faster than any constant discount rate, the benefits of additional population become infinite when considered over an infinite timeframe. This is particularly relevant for longtermist philosophical perspectives that favor zero discount rates.\n\nEven when we impose cutoff dates to achieve finite results, the benefits remain enormous. Under a 2.5% rate, the marginal benefits increase rapidly with population growth, showing an especially steep slope. The 5% and 7% scenarios still show significant benefits, though my previous estimates were slightly too high for 5% but considerably too low for 7%.\n\nIn every case analyzed - even the most conservative scenarios - the present value of births represents at least 55% of current global production, and in extreme cases reaches 33 times greater than global production. This suggests that standard government spending priorities, particularly non-research health spending, may be significantly misaligned with optimal population benefits when properly accounting for discount rates."

  {
    "question": "What are the implications of these population benefit calculations for government policy priorities?",
    "answer": "The calculations reveal dramatically high marginal benefits from additional births - so high that they dwarf many other government spending priorities. Most notably, non-research health spending likely produces gains far below the population benefits calculated here, which range from 55% to over 3300% of global annual production depending on discount rates and timeframes considered.\n\nThe profound scale of these benefits suggests we should fundamentally reorient government policy priorities. Housing restrictions that reduce birth rates may actually cause more harm through their demographic effects than through their direct economic impacts. This implies that policies affecting fertility should be evaluated much more carefully for their population impacts.\n\nFor longtermists who apply a zero discount rate, the optimal population subsidy is effectively unlimited. Even for non-longtermists using higher discount rates, the benefits are so large relative to government spending capacity that they suggest population growth should be a paramount policy priority.\n\nI will explore specific policy optimization opportunities in more detail in future analysis, but these findings strongly indicate that governments should shift resources toward programs that enable and encourage population growth, potentially at the expense of other spending priorities that cannot match these extraordinary marginal benefits."

  {
    "question": "How much should we be willing to spend to increase population growth?",
    "answer": "The optimal spending level for increasing population growth is effectively unlimited. For those following longtermist philosophical views (with a zero discount rate), the benefits are literally infinite due to compounding technological progress from a larger population. Even for those using conventional discount rates, the marginal benefits are so large as to exceed practical government spending capabilities.\n\nUsing a 2.5% discount rate and counting benefits only to 2300, the present value of additional births equals 33 times global annual production in the most extreme case modeled. Even in the most conservative scenario (higher discount rates, shorter time horizons), the benefits still equal 55% of world production.\n\nImportantly, these benefits increase rapidly with population growth - the marginal benefit curves show steep positive slopes, particularly at lower discount rates, meaning that even large initial subsidies would be justified as they would lead to even higher marginal benefits from subsequent population increases.\n\nThe implications are quite striking - we should be willing to spend far more than current estimates of $210,000-$1,200,000 per additional birth. In fact, the limiting factor becomes not the theoretical optimal subsidy amount, but rather practical constraints on government spending capacity. This suggests we should radically reprioritize spending toward population growth, as many current expenditures (like non-research health spending) likely have far lower returns than population-increasing measures."

  {
    "question": "Are current government spending priorities aligned with the true value of additional births?",
    "answer": "No, current government spending priorities are severely misaligned with the enormous value of additional births. The marginal technological externalities of births are so large that even under conservative discount rates and time horizons, the value of an additional birth ranges from 55% to over 3300% of current global annual production. Yet governments typically spend far more on non-research health spending and other programs that likely generate much lower returns.\n\nThis misalignment is particularly striking when we consider that even under the most conservative estimates, the value of additional births far exceeds what governments could reasonably spend on population subsidies. The fact that many government policies - particularly housing restrictions - may actually reduce birth rates is especially concerning, as this could be their most significant negative impact.\n\nA fundamental reorientation of government spending priorities toward policies that encourage population growth would be more aligned with these tremendous benefits. The current allocation of resources suggests policymakers are dramatically undervaluing the long-term technological and economic gains that additional births generate through their contribution to human innovation and productivity."

  {
    "question": "How should housing policy account for its effects on birth rates?",
    "answer": "Given the extremely high value of additional births - with even conservative estimates showing marginal technological externalities worth more than half of global GDP - housing policy that restricts fertility through higher costs could be causing tremendous damage. In fact, the negative effect of housing restrictions on birth rates might be their most significant drawback, even more important than their direct economic costs.\n\nSince the model shows that the marginal benefit of births increases rapidly with population size (particularly at lower discount rates), any policy that systematically reduces fertility across a population could have outsized negative effects that compound over time. Housing restrictions that raise the cost of adequate family housing likely fall into this category.\n\nThis suggests that liberalizing zoning laws and reducing building restrictions should be an urgent priority, not just for traditional economic efficiency reasons, but because of their effect on fertility decisions. The astronomical value of additional births (infinite under longtermist perspectives, and effectively infinite even under conventional discount rates) means that even small positive effects on birth rates from cheaper housing could generate massive benefits through technological externalities."
