    "question": "How should we think about regulation differently when we consider its impact on global innovation?",
    "answer": "The key insight is that we've been dramatically underestimating the negative externalities of regulation by focusing primarily on domestic effects. When we account for regulation's impact on global innovation, the optimal level of regulation is likely far lower than what we currently consider optimal from a domestic perspective.\n\nThis stems from two crucial factors: First, while most regulatory costs and benefits are internalized within the implementing country, the innovation-suppressing effects of regulation spill over to all countries due to technology being a global public good. Second, even small reductions in trend growth rates compound to massive welfare losses over time.\n\nMy analysis suggests that if we value foreign welfare equally to domestic welfare, and if current regulation levels are domestically optimal, the optimal level of regulation should actually be about 78% lower than present levels. This is a stark finding - the negative innovation externality from U.S. regulation alone approaches the magnitude of climate change in terms of GDP effects.\n\nHowever, this creates a practical challenge: without perfect information about which regulations are most harmful to innovation, random elimination of regulations could accidentally remove some of the most beneficial ones. Still, given the magnitude of the innovation externality, even random elimination would likely create net benefits unless regulation reduces GDP growth by less than 0.4% annually.\n\nWe must start viewing regulation through this global lens, recognizing that when we implement regulations that hamper innovation, we're not just affecting our own citizens - we're potentially slowing technological progress for the entire world."

    "question": "What is the true cost of regulation when we consider its effects beyond national borders?",
    "answer": "The true cost of regulation, when accounting for its international effects, is staggeringly larger than commonly understood. This is primarily because regulation's suppression of innovation affects all countries globally, not just the implementing nation, since technological advancement functions as a public good in the long run. My analysis shows that the increase in US regulations since 1949 has likely reduced global income per capita by 27.8%, representing an annual loss of 1.56 billion utils or 78.7 trillion Open Phil dollars.\n\nThe key insight is that while most regulatory effects (like cleaner water or safer consumer goods) are internalized within the implementing country, the innovation-dampening effect spills over globally. Even small reductions in trend growth rates compound dramatically over time - a fact that makes this externality comparable to, and potentially greater than, the GDP effects of climate change from US actions alone.\n\nIf we value foreign welfare equally to domestic welfare, this analysis suggests the optimal level of regulation should be roughly 78% lower than current levels, assuming the present level is domestically optimal. This is a profound conclusion that challenges our current regulatory framework, though implementing such changes would require careful consideration of which regulations to eliminate, as we often lack perfect information about their relative costs and benefits."

    "question": "How does including innovation externalities change our calculation of optimal regulation levels?",
    "answer": "The inclusion of innovation externalities dramatically reduces the optimal level of regulation. My analysis shows that if we value foreign welfare equally to domestic welfare, the optimal level of regulation should decrease by approximately 78% from current levels, assuming the current level is privately optimal for the implementing country.\n\nThis stark conclusion stems from three key factors:\n1. Regulation's significant negative impact on growth rates (approximately 1.1% annually based on averaged studies)\n2. The public good nature of technological innovation across countries\n3. The compounding effects of even small changes in growth rates over time\n\nThe magnitude of this effect is so large that it makes regulatory innovation externalities comparable to, and potentially soon greater than, the GDP effects of climate change - and this is just considering U.S. regulations alone.\n\nEven if we lack perfect information about which regulations to cut, the externality is so substantial that random elimination of regulations would still likely yield positive expected value unless regulation reduces GDP growth due to innovation by less than 0.4% annually.\n\nWhile this conclusion could be overturned if regulatory innovation elasticity was overestimated by a factor of 3 or if current regulation levels are vastly suboptimal, the scale of innovation externalities suggests we should seriously reconsider our regulatory approach when accounting for global welfare."

    "question": "Should countries consider global welfare effects when setting their regulatory policies?",
    "answer": "Yes, countries absolutely should consider global welfare effects when setting regulatory policies, particularly due to the enormous externalities created through innovation effects. The analysis shows that regulation's impact on technological progress and innovation creates massive spillover effects that affect all countries, not just the implementing nation. When we consider that even small changes in growth rates compound dramatically over time, the welfare implications become staggering - potentially reducing global income per capita by 27.8% in the case of U.S. regulations since 1949.\n\nThe current regulatory framework, where countries primarily consider domestic costs and benefits, is likely leading to significant over-regulation from a global welfare perspective. My calculations suggest that if we value foreign welfare equally to domestic welfare, the optimal level of regulation would be about 78% lower than current levels, assuming the present level is domestically optimal.\n\nHowever, this conclusion comes with important caveats. The practical implementation of globally-optimal regulation faces challenges, such as uncertainty about which specific regulations to maintain or remove. Additionally, the conclusion could be altered if regulatory innovation elasticities were significantly overestimated or if current regulation levels are substantially below domestic optimums. Nevertheless, the sheer magnitude of the innovation externality suggests that incorporating global welfare considerations into regulatory policy-making is crucial for maximizing human welfare overall."

    "question": "How significant is the innovation-suppressing effect of regulation compared to other global challenges like climate change?",
    "answer": "The innovation-suppressing effect of regulation is remarkably significant, approaching and potentially exceeding the GDP-effect basis of climate change. Looking at just U.S. regulations alone, their negative impact on global innovation creates a staggering welfare loss of approximately 40 billion utils and 1.99 quadrillion Open Phil dollars (when discounted to infinity at 5%). This makes it comparable to, and likely soon to exceed, the entire GDP impact of climate change from a purely economic perspective.\n\nHowever, I should note an important caveat: when considering total welfare effects, climate change still remains considerably more important from a welfarist perspective. This is because climate change can reduce GDP per capita in vulnerable countries like India by up to 92% compared to potential, with devastating reductions in consumption utility if people cannot freely migrate to cooler regions. The regulatory innovation externality calculation also doesn't yet account for the effects of other countries' (generally stricter) regulations or the complex impacts of comparative advantage.\n\nSo while the innovation-suppressing effect of regulation represents an enormous and often overlooked global challenge, we shouldn't necessarily conclude it surpasses climate change in overall importance to human welfare. The key insight is that both issues operate on a truly massive scale when we consider their long-term effects on global economic growth and development."

    "question": "How should we weigh the local benefits of regulation against its global innovation costs?",
    "answer": "The analysis suggests that when we account for global innovation externalities, the optimal level of regulation should be dramatically lower than what might be privately optimal for a single country. The key insight is that while the benefits and costs of most regulations are internalized within the implementing country, their negative effects on innovation represent a massive externality that affects technological progress worldwide.\n\nThe calculations indicate that if we value foreign welfare equally to domestic welfare, and assuming the current level of regulation is privately optimal, the optimal regulatory level should decrease by around 78%. This is because regulatory burden appears to reduce trend growth rates by approximately 1.1% annually, and even small reductions in trend growth compound to enormous welfare losses over time when considered globally.\n\nHowever, this conclusion comes with important caveats. First, we need better information about which regulations to remove, as random elimination could accidentally remove the most beneficial ones. Second, if the regulatory innovation elasticity estimates are significantly overstated (by a factor of 3 or more), or if current regulation levels are actually far below the private optimum, the conclusion might change.\n\nThe practical implication is that regulators should place much greater weight on innovation effects when considering new regulations, and potentially adopt a strong presumption against regulations that might impede technological progress unless their local benefits are extraordinarily large."

    "question": "Are current regulatory frameworks too extensive when we consider their impact on worldwide technological progress?",
    "answer": "Yes, current regulatory frameworks appear significantly too extensive when accounting for their global innovation externalities. My analysis suggests that if we value foreign welfare equally to domestic welfare, the optimal level of regulation in the United States should be approximately 78% lower than current levels, assuming the present amount is domestically optimal.\n\nThe key insight is that while most regulatory costs and benefits are internalized within the implementing country, the dampening effect on innovation affects the entire world due to technological progress being a public good in the long run. Using conservative estimates from multiple studies, I found that regulation reduces annual growth rates by approximately 1.1%. While this may seem small, the compounding effects over time are enormous - affecting living standards by factors of many multiples over a century.\n\nEven with conservative assumptions about technological diffusion rates (10-year lag to reach 30% of world population) and using a 5% discount rate, the global welfare losses from US regulation alone are staggering - equivalent to tens of billions of utils or quadrillions in dollar terms when projected forward.\n\nThe conclusion is quite robust - the regulatory burden would need to be reduced by over three-quarters to reach the global optimum. In fact, the externality is so large that even with imperfect information about which regulations to cut, randomly removing regulations would likely lead to net benefits. The only way this conclusion might be overturned is if current regulation levels are vastly suboptimal domestically, if the regulatory innovation elasticity was overestimated by more than 3x, or if there are substantial differences in the elasticities of regulatory costs and benefits that we haven't accounted for."

    "question": "How do we balance domestic regulatory benefits against international innovation costs?",
    "answer": "The analysis suggests that when we properly account for innovation externalities, we should dramatically reduce regulatory burdens - potentially by around 78% if we value foreign welfare equally to domestic welfare and if current regulation levels are domestically optimal. This is because regulation's suppression of innovation affects not just the implementing country, but creates significant negative spillovers for technological advancement globally.\n\nThe key consideration is that even small reductions in trend growth rates compound to massive welfare effects over time. A country's regulations might provide local benefits (like cleaner water or safer products), but by hampering innovation, they deny potentially transformative technologies to the entire world. Given that technological discovery is a public good in the long run, and that the welfare impacts compound dramatically over decades, the global innovation costs generally dwarf domestic regulatory benefits.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean we should eliminate all regulation - we need some confidence about which regulations are most harmful to innovation versus which provide crucial domestic protections. With imperfect information about regulation impacts, we should be somewhat more conservative, though the externality is so large that substantial deregulation would likely still be optimal even with uncertainty. The minimum threshold is that if regulation reduces GDP growth by more than 0.4% annually due to innovation effects, wholesale deregulation would be justified even without perfect knowledge of which regulations are most harmful.\n\nThe optimal balance requires carefully weighing these massive long-term global innovation costs against immediate domestic benefits, while accounting for uncertainty in our regulatory impact estimates."

    "question": "What would optimal regulation look like if we valued foreign welfare equally to domestic welfare?",
    "answer": "If we value foreign and domestic welfare equally, the optimal level of regulation would be dramatically lower than current levels - approximately 78% lower than today's level, assuming the current amount is domestically optimal. This conclusion stems from the massive negative externality that regulation has on global innovation and economic growth. When a country implements regulations, it reduces innovation that would have benefited the entire world, since technological advancement is ultimately a public good.\n\nThe magnitude of this effect is staggering - our calculations suggest that global income per capita would be 27.8% higher had the increase in US regulations since 1949 not occurred. Even if we have imperfect information about which regulations are most harmful, the externality is so large that significant deregulation would still be optimal. In fact, without perfect knowledge of regulatory impacts, abolishing the entire regulatory codebook would bring a net annual gain of 230 million utils or 11.5 trillion OpenPhil dollars.\n\nHowever, this conclusion could be challenged if: (1) our regulatory innovation elasticity estimates are off by more than a factor of 3, (2) current regulation is vastly suboptimal domestically, or (3) the elasticities of regulatory benefits and costs are substantially different than assumed. These caveats notwithstanding, the clear implication is that considering global welfare would push us toward much lighter regulation than we currently have."

    "question": "How should policymakers approach regulation differently if they care about global technological progress?",
    "answer": "Given the massive externalities involved, policymakers should dramatically scale back regulation if they value global technological progress equally to domestic welfare. The analysis shows that if the current level of regulation is privately optimal for domestic welfare, including innovation externalities suggests we should reduce regulation by about 78%. This is because regulatory burdens suppress innovation, which is ultimately a global public good, creating enormous long-term costs that extend far beyond national borders.\n\nEven with imperfect information about which regulations are most harmful, the externality is so large that aggressive deregulation would likely create net benefits. The calculations suggest that completely random removal of regulations would still be beneficial unless the negative impact on growth is less than 0.4% annually - well below the empirical estimates of regulation's growth effects.\n\nThe key insight is that even small effects on trend growth rates compound dramatically over time and across populations. When we consider that technological advances eventually benefit the entire world, the welfare costs of innovation-suppressing regulation are staggering - on the order of tens of billions of utils or quadrillions of dollars in present value terms.\n\nPolicymakers should therefore shift to viewing regulation through a global lens, being far more hesitant to implement new regulations and actively working to reduce existing regulatory burdens, particularly in frontier economies that drive technological progress. The benefits to humanity from faster technological advancement likely dwarf most domestic regulatory considerations."
