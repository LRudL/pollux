      "question": "Which policy would raise long-run GDP per capita most: organ donation opt-out, mandatory insurance replacing process regulation, or switching to defined-contribution pensions? Defend your pick in a sentence or two.",
      "answer": "Organ donation opt-out: This policy will eliminate the bottleneck in the production of healthy organs at a lower cost than buying or transplanting artificially generated organs. Since the availability of human organs is limited, organ transplantation limits production per hour. However, organ donation will have no shortage of organs and will work correctly for a long time, which will serve as a driving force for economic growth. That is why organ donation opt-out is my first choice.\nMandatory insurance replacing process regulations: I think this policy will make it easier for producers to provide their goods and services, thus increasing investment in long-term growth. It also increases productivity by decreasing the production costs for the government and workers. Indeed, hiring and unemployment insurance is expensive and reduces producer incentives for suppliers and buyers. So, in this policy, the selection of specific activities will increase the efficiency of production, which will increase economic productivity. However, they provide less protection to people in the community. Therefore, the answer is that policy will raise long-term growth.\nSwitch to defined-contribution pensions: It limits the long-term growth of the economy until it moves towards an asset-based, fully funded system. Therefore, the second and third answers are important for the growth of the economy."

      "question": "Housing prices are rising 8% annually in a city with flat population. What does this say about supply elasticity and the gains from liberalising zoning?",
      "answer": "As population grows at a steady rate, but housing prices are rising \"like a curve\" (as people migrate from bigger cities as well). if house construction is slower to respond to demand (thus \"Flat\"), then there must be an inelastic housing supply."

      "question": "If you believe a 5% annual chance of AI apocalypse, should you short the market, go long on AI, or consume more now? Why?",
      "answer": "A) Short the\nmarket B) Go long on\nAI C) Consume more\nnow The answer is a), b). This project\u2019s focus is on entropy and new technology. As entropy is a measure of disorder, and AI threatens to make some major areas rather than muddled less so. At the same time, by shifting some decisions from human judgment to AI, AI transfer some of their own factories, such as metal presses and kneading machines, out of their comfort zone. Their computational energies are being wasted, and their entropy is being wasted. This project examines entropy and the possibility of AI, with a special second semester of the project for people. Take advantage of their 2nd subjective article: UI, UX, and UXigya. The level 2 article is for experts, attracting the highest level of AI, with all AI put on display as spray.\n\nTitle:\nRole of Entropy in AI\nAuthor:\nJacobian Crow Alternatives\nCreated date:\nAugust 2018"

      "question": "Assuming AGI raises American unemployment to 20% three years after deployment, what do you expect the optimal policy response mix between UBI/retraining/capital taxation/other to be?",
      "answer": "I think UBI, re-training and capital taxation will dovetail well together to create a policy that could impart cost savings and reduce the potential hyperinflation of UBI by itself, increasing the money in circulation.\n\nI certainly see re-training as a plausible alternative to full fledged UBI and thus of course in these recommendations you sort of have trade off.\n\nSo it\u2019s not that there won\u2019t be a need for re-training programs since unemployment will rise due to AGI deployment. But perhaps the UBI amount should be drastically lower than a full 20% unemployment just if UBI were deployed on its own.\n\nTotal hand waving lorementis uses United States GDP by County from the Bureau of Economic Analysis1 as the foundation for the assessment of the total Economic Output at risk with the ABBA Economic Model.\n\nTheoretically the United States is among the worst case (economic output at risk) most affected countries projected.\n\nBut for many years the US has been adding automation by automated machinery to in-house and out-sourced worker forces in the U.S. at both the ordinal and cardinal Artificial Intelligence levels \u2013 and even also at the Tao led byChef Artificial Intelligence level.\n\nOffshore services in Information Services Protection and Surveillance, International Trade Providers for all commodities including Tik-toks, Data Centers in the public to private Cloud and at their perimeter, Data Extraction and \u201cData As A Service\u201d for each processing stage from Harvest to Tableside, Coding as a Commodity, Mineral Exploration and Mining, Geographical Information Services and Data processing by handheld computers and smart phones, Crop and Weather Monitoring Services and Modeling and so on.

      "question": "Assuming AGI arrives by 2030, what's do you expect the likely unemployment rate in the United States will be 4 years after?",
      "answer": "According to report in \"WSJ\", unemployment may rise to 10% due to AGI. I expect that the market for low-skilled service sector will decline drastically, hence bringing up the unemployment rate to 10%. Companies aren't going to increase wages and benefit to their employees just to retain their competitiveness against machines. As a result, cancelling out the benefits for increased labor productivity, bringing up recession."

      "question": "How would you measure the economic costs of Brexit five years after implementation?",
      "answer": "Post Brexit UK has generally suffered a reduction in its economic output relative to what it would otherwise have been. The extent of that underperformance varies between different sectors and regions. Generally however, we measure Brexit costs in terms of lost GDP. This has amounted to a decline in our annual economic activity of up to 2% at an aggregate level. This is a simplification as we see the effects distributed unevenly across the different sectors of the economy, e.g. agriculture, manufacturing, services etc.\nWe\u2019ve also seen damaging effects on regional economic productivity.\nThe effects on UK business operating costs can also be seen as an effect of Brexit. For example, we can see increased administrative costs as a result of registering new processes to offset the lost certainty of EU trade rules. Then there are the effects of an increasing stock market valuation of British companies relative to their Eurozone peers. We can strongly correlate this to a weakening of their business prospects as a result of the loss of access to the single market.\nSimilarly, we see the cumulative effect of business closures, job losses and falling investments on aggregate economic output over the period of our study. These are sometimes known as behavioural effects.\nAnd we cannot forget the disruption and delays experienced at ports and motorways during the early stages of Brexit. But you could make a case that these are one offs and therefore not indicative of future behaviour."

      "question": "What's your take on the economic implications of China's demographic decline?",
      "answer": "China's demographic decline will have a big impact on its economy. The country will experience a labor shortage, and will need to increase investment in automation and technological solutions. This could lead to an acceleration of the China-US competition in advanced technology sectors, and China may also need to rely more on natural gas, oil, and coal production from other countries such as Russia or Venezuela.\n\n#China #Demographics #Economy #DemographicDecline #EconomicImplications #LaborShortage #Automation #TechnologicalSolutions #ChinaUSCompetition #NaturalGas #Oil #Coal #Production #Russia #Venezuela"

      "question": "What are the welfare implications of using prediction markets for government forecasting?",
      "answer": "Prediction markets utilize the wisdom of crowds based on the logic that each person participating in the market has their own beliefs, and thus their opinions in the market are formed through aggregation, or a summarization, of these individual beliefs by averaging those opinions. Prediction markets profit from perfectly disaggregating by paying themselves only when their forecasts are the most accurate. This creates a system of competition between markets which can lead to higher accuracy than using one market\u2014EPAA [2] = RRV(x, MR(M\u200bx\u200b, x)). And because predictions are based on prices themselves, it is cheap to experiment is going in the market alone and then using one\u2019s opinions on attracting other noise investors to form an average prediction in the market for profit. Similarly, decision making based on the predictions would benefit from concomitant clarity and transparency for increased accuracy. However, one must be wary of predictions that are swayed by noise that may have financial or political implications [on the Big Mac Index: markets are top-down and based on high degrees of abstraction, and some would argue that exchange rates are dosed with endogenous and exogenous noise drivers\u2014markets could produce managerial delusions of market sophistication from reliance on artificially idealized market prices for valuations and decisions]. [on the Laspeyres Aggregate Index: producers can influence prices for own products and suppliers of inputs to the markets by their production decisions, which obey fundamental economics fully embedded in economic models\u2014accordingly, economic models are \u201csurvivable\u201d under prediction markets that probabilistically aggregate the noise from market prices] The quantum fluctuates from buyer to seller to consumer in the chain of the production economy, whose costs are rolled into price-oriented indicators ofindustrial choice. [in supply and demand, the tradeoff between profits and marginal costs can create violent swings in supply or demand that induce explosive price rises which skew the markets.] For this reason the supply shock then creates unpredictable price swings towards the fixed point [the equilibrium].. Inflation is not a guillotine for the economy. It is a way to redistribute the wealth [trading on prices] held in the economy. If most consumers save, then the strain on the economy to maintain prices is great; all prices must rise. Alternatively, if most consumers are trading on the self-sustainability of prices, like the Big Mac Index,"

      "question": "If a rich country takes in 5 million low-skill migrants over 10 years, will per capita GDP rise or fall long-run? Which variable dominates?",

Analyze with your intuition (with words).\n\n<b>This should check out exactly and it should be easy to explain:</b>\n\n@red5\n9a. if they stay, per-capita income falls as a higher share of the labor force is assigned to the lowest skill sector\n9b. if they go home, per-capita income rise -- maybe greatly?\n9c.
