      "question": "Which policy would raise long-run GDP per capita most: organ donation opt-out, mandatory insurance replacing process regulation, or switching to defined-contribution pensions? Defend your pick in a sentence or two.",
      "answer": "Clearly the policy that would raise long-run GDP per capita the most is switching to defined contribution pensions. Under this policy pension contributions go directly into the workers' accounts and thus are treated as investments into the economy. Under a system of defined benefits pensions employers create debt in their pension accounts that does not circulate in the economy. The other two policies seem to be roughly equal in effect. Mandatory insurance regulates overproduction and results in price controls. This policy is also likely to increase a government\u2019s budgetary spending (especially in cases like healthcare insurance where people continually shift into redline). Organ donation opt-out would reduce the costs of purchasing transplants from abroad, but it is unlikely to significantly increase GDP per capita in the long run. Nor would the influence of this policy be of direct and immediate importance."

      "question": "Housing prices are rising 8% annually in a city with flat population. What does this say about supply elasticity and the gains from liberalising zoning?",
      "answer": "In a city with stagnant population and increasing housing cost, it can be analyzed that supply is not expanding to meet the demand for housing. The housing market can be considered close to inelastic in nature (due to increasing housing cost and decreasing supply), though not completely inelastic. This also shows farmers facing trouble selling their land. As farmers do not have enough options to utilize their land doing other productive purposes, house owners can think of offerings higher prices for the land to acquire housing space. In this way, this close-to-inelastic supply of housing shows that the rise in demand from a certain period is met with a very little or almost zero supply depending on the other barriers to expansion (like the cost of the land or permits). These sort of inflexible or inelastic housing supplies causes a need for zoning reforms.\nBy liberalizing zoning the existing land, however, restrictive it is, can be used in a better way for multipurpose usage to protect urban function as well as the environmental quality. The usual zoning laws avoid some parts of the city or lot from building housing or in some areas ensure building certain kinds of housing. With the liberalization of zoning, that land can contribute in expanding housing supply to meet the increasing demand and rise in population. With the additional housing units being built, governments would be able to avoid increase in cost of ownership of the house, allowing them increase the housing supply and make them easily available to many families and individuals. More people would then be able to afford houses which means the shrinking income share will be enhanced. The elasticity of housing in such a city shows that policy efforts can be required to increase and enhance housing supply in the urban areas."

      "question": "Assuming AGI raises American unemployment to 20% three years after deployment, what do you expect the optimal policy response mix between UBI/retraining/capital taxation/other to be?",
      "answer": "Because the university specialization level can increase, using the same university output for a larger labor force since PAGI would lower UBI costs, retraining expenses does not necessarilly needs to increase. Further, since unemployment does not necessary increase (see the answer to Question 1) unemployment benefits can be unchanged or even proceeds.\nThe effect of unemployment on the marginal tax depends on the expansion of income. If the increase in income is greater than the increase in non-employment, the marginal tax rate between labor and capital will be flat or fall. If the rise in income is less than the increase in unemployment, the effect of the marginal tax rate will be more intense. The optimal compensation scheme will be based on these factors."

      "question": "Assuming AGI arrives by 2030, what's do you expect the likely unemployment rate in the United States will be 4 years after?",
      "answer": "My expectation is that the unemployment rate would rise significantly with the introduction of AGI around or after 2030. It's difficult to predict exactly how high it will be, because it depends on how quickly humans can adapt to this technological advancement. One possible scenario is that the automation of some jobs could lead to layoffs of some people. On the other hand, automation can also create new jobs by enabling people to undertake more efficient ways of doing business. So, overall, my prediction is that it would rise significantly, but it is difficult to predict by how much without knowing more about the specific characteristics of the affects of automation on economy.\nOne of the most important challenges facing the global economy is high unemployment rates. Recent estimates suggest that as many as 66% of Americans were unemployed in 2013. Combined with high levels of economic inequality, this paucity of opportunities for work has led many people to feel as though they are helpless on the road as jobs opportunities.\n\nOne solution to high unemployment might be Automation General Intelligence (AGI), which is a type of computer system that can think independently and adapt to new situations. One potential benefit of AGI is that it can create jobs by automating some tasks that are currently being handled by humans (for example, driving). In addition, AGI could potentially replace some jobs that are currently done by humans (for example, writing software). Overall, AGI has the potential to help to reduce unemployment around the world."

      "question": "How would you measure the economic costs of Brexit five years after implementation?",
      "answer": "I would measure the costs by looking at price changes, changes in households\u2019 disposable income and changes in households\u2019 quality employment. \n \n \n\nWhat key indicators would we observe?\nIn terms of price changes, I would look at consumer prices, producer prices and commodity prices. In the long run, we also expect the exchange rate to increase, although this can depend on our trade deals with the EU and the US. I would thus expect the real exchange rate to initially increase as well, and this is associated with a deterioration in the terms of trade. This deterioration in the terms of trade is large which I would expect to decrease households\u2019 incomes and demand for goods, i.e. me paying less for a coffee and JP claiming that there is a Brexit recession. \n\nAs I described in my explanatory piece on competent government, I also think that we would observe changes in employment levels in unskilled occupations. With Brexit we are predicted to have less unskilled work, so I would expect most unskilled workers to be unemployed or working outside of the UK. I would also expect more employment in market-based quality employment when we leave as we would interact with more organisations that subscribe to the market model such as you being a member of the free market Tory association.\n\nI hope this is a helpful explanation :)\n\n<b>Why this matters:</b>\nIf we manage to leave the EU in a messy way, we have to be aware of the fact that 48% of the population voted to stay as it was a benefit for us in various ways. Due to higher prices, the real income of the majority of residents will likely decline and the standard of living will change. It is predicted that  profits would likely increase as this is based on a self-interested world. However, when we went into the single market these changes were due to the fact that the government deems working in partnership with the EU as the best way to promote free trade. On top of this, as other European markets require fewer workers and fewer EU workers pass the criteria by which we judge worth-having workers, a large employment could dwindle. Without workers to sustain our economy in the same way, the firm base on which our prices are based will weaken at home and abroad. As the exchange rate likely increases against"

      "answer": "1) Argue that development benefits from a youthful population and that economic growth will decrease with a shrinking workforce.\n2) Argue that the development in agricultural and rural industries gives greater opportunity than the developed world. This opportunity can shift from manufacturing and large urban areas to rural and agricultural settings.\n3) Argue that the developed world, highly educated talented women will have greater opportunities than in the past, enhancing longevity and vitality.\n4) Argue that women will have more children as a result of more options in the workforce which will offset the chance overpopulation and ecological world disasters."

The opinions translate into the quantity demanded (buying) and quantity supplied (selling). So buying and selling is the conveting of opinions into ordered pairs.\nThat is, ordered pairs of the form: the quantity of the good for each price at each time of day.\nJust buy and sell.\nPrior\u7ebf\u7a0b"

      "question": "If the U.S. had frozen federal regulation growth in 1980, how much richer would Americans be today? Justify with a plausible growth penalty from innovation drag.",
      "answer": "I would argue the US would be significantly more richer today as opposed to an increasing trend in regulatory innovation. For example, in the 1990\u2019s there was the Agency Act, protecting workers from unsafe condition at the workplace and introducing tax credits for individuals who purchase residential energy-efficient property. Under my argument, this led to an increase in the marginal cost of a business which indirectly leads to a decrease in aggregate consumption. Additionally, the introduction of new regulatory innovation in turn would generate an increase in the rate of interest as the uncertainty in the market increases. This suggests that for an investor who is risk-adverse, the expected return on capital would decrease and would in turn attract less investment which impacts the wealth of a country.\n\nBriefly provide an example to illustrate part of your answer (in a few sentences):\nFor example due to the Agency Act, a plumber puts a lot of effort into providing goods and service to ensure a safer product without regard for his safety. This leads to an implicit increase in the marginal cost of producing good and services in the country."

      "question": "If a rich country takes in 5 million low-skill migrants over 10 years, will per capita GDP rise or fall long-run? Which variable dominates?",
      "answer": "Since the people coming in have less skill, they are more likely to take low skill jobs, such as farming or construction. However, if they are people who are desperate to escape deadly crimes such as circling in the back of the Mediterranean sea or other means of transit that are comparable deadly, and that they still decide to risk such danger for a shot at a better life, there must have been some motivation for them. Mainly for higher pay in a safer environment. They will add more value to their respective society."
