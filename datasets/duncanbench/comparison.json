      "prompt": "Question: What are the welfare implications of using prediction markets for government forecasting?\n\nAnswers:\n\nC. Limited use for most policy questions, and most governments don't have well defined enough social welfare functions to effectively leverage. First order impact wouldn't be from making decisions closer to revealed preference utility function but making them more utilitarian.\n\nB. Prediction markets for government forecasting have mixed welfare implications. On the positive side, they can aggregate diverse information and expertise to produce more accurate forecasts, potentially leading to better policy decisions. However, they raise concerns about equity and manipulation - wealthy participants may have outsized influence, and there are risks of insider trading or strategic behavior that could distort predictions. The net welfare effect likely depends on careful market design and regulation to maximize accuracy while minimizing potential downsides.\n\nA. Prediction markets have been shown to perform well at directing resources into productive investments. While markets are well understood for making \"fair\" bets on the future, they have only recently been employed to make official government forecasts. Predictions derived from these using designed markets can be substantially more accurate than the consensus forecasts of experts.
