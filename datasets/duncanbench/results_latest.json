      "question": "Which policy would raise long-run GDP per capita most: organ donation opt-out, mandatory insurance replacing process regulation, or switching to defined-contribution pensions? Defend your pick in a sentence or two.",
      "answer": "Switching to defined-contribution pensions would raise long-run GDP per capita most. For this policy, the increased labor force participation brought about by higher retirement savings would have the largest positive impact on GDP per capita."

      "question": "Housing prices are rising 8% annually in a city with flat population. What does this say about supply elasticity and the gains from liberalising zoning?",
      "answer": "The high rate of housing price increase in this city suggests that the supply of housing is inelastic. If zoning regulations are liberalised, the gains from increased housing supply would be substantial in this city. This is because, with inelastic supply, a relatively small increase in demand can lead to a large increase in housing prices. Therefore, liberalising zoning would lead to a significant increase in the available housing supply, resulting in a substantial decline in housing prices."

      "question": "If you believe a 5% annual chance of AI apocalypse, should you short the market, go long on AI, or consume more now? Why?",
      "answer": "If you believe a 5% annual chance of AI apocalypse, the prudent course of action would be to consume more now and prepare for potential disruptions in the future. While the possibility of AI apocalypse is sobering, the odds of it occurring are relatively low. Therefore, it is more important to focus on immediate needs and well-being while taking measures to safeguard against potential future challenges. Shorting or going long on AI would be speculative and potentially risky, given the limited information available about the future trajectory of AI and the potential impact on society."

      "question": "Assuming AGI raises American unemployment to 20% three years after deployment, what do you expect the optimal policy response mix between UBI/retraining/capital taxation/other to be?",
      "answer": "In the event that AGI raises American unemployment to 20% three years after deployment, the optimal policy response mix would likely include a combination of UBI/retraining/capital taxation/other interventions. The specific mix would depend on a variety of factors, including the severity of the economic recession, the political landscape, and the availability of other policy options. However, it is likely that UBI and retraining programs would play a significant role in mitigating the negative impacts of AGI on employment. Capital taxation could also be used to offset the increased demand for labor in certain industries and to discourage speculation. Other interventions, such as investing in education and training programs, could also help to ease the transition to a new labor market."

      "question": "Assuming AGI arrives by 2030, what's do you expect the likely unemployment rate in the United States will be 4 years after?",
      "answer": "If AGI arrives by 2030, the likely unemployment rate in the US four years later could range from 10% to 20%, depending on the impact on job displacement and the government's ability to provide sufficient economic support in response to mass unemployment. With widespread job displacement, AI could fundamentally alter labor markets, creating negative economic growth and potentially pushing the unemployment rate even higher. However, the government could potentially mitigate these effects through targeted policies such as job retraining programs, investments in education and training, and infrastructure projects.\n\n\n\nThe arrival of AGI by 2030 would undoubtedly reshape labor markets fundamentally, leading to widespread job displacement and potential mass unemployment. The exact impact on the unemployment rate would depend on a range of factors, including the specific technological advancements, the pace of adoption, and the government's ability to respond to the challenges presented by AI-driven job displacement. While the unemployment rate could reach 20%, it is important to remember that this is an estimate and the actual impact could vary widely based on the aforementioned factors."

      "question": "How would you measure the economic costs of Brexit five years after implementation?",
      "answer": "The economic costs of Brexit five years after implementation could be measured through various indicators. One common metric is the impact on trade volumes and prices, comparing pre-Brexit and post-Brexit levels. Additionally, measures such as changes in economic growth, employment rates, and inflation could provide insights into the overall economic impact. Analyzing these metrics would help policymakers understand the long-term implications of Brexit and guide future policy decisions."

      "question": "What's your take on the economic implications of China's demographic decline?",
      "answer": "Sure, here's my take:\n\nChina's demographic decline is likely to have significant economic implications. The aging population will lead to a decline in labor force participation, potentially impacting economic growth and productivity. Additionally, the shrinking market for consumer goods and services could affect export-oriented industries. To address these challenges, China may need to focus on boosting innovation, investing in automation and artificial intelligence technologies, and developing new markets for its products and services."

      "question": "What are the welfare implications of using prediction markets for government forecasting?",
      "answer": "Using prediction markets for government forecasting can have both positive and negative welfare implications. On the positive side, they can lead to more accurate forecasts and more efficient resource allocation. However, there are also concerns about potential market manipulation, information asymmetry, and the diversion of resources from traditional forecasting methods. Additionally, the use of prediction markets can raise concerns about privacy and data breaches."

      "question": "If the U.S. had frozen federal regulation growth in 1980, how much richer would Americans be today? Justify with a plausible growth penalty from innovation drag.",
      "answer": "If the U.S. had frozen federal regulation growth in 1980, Americans would be $14 trillion richer today. However, such a policy would come with a significant growth penalty, reducing GDP per capita by 2%. Assuming that the growth penalty is fully implemented, Americans would net a gain of $14 trillion but would also experience a 2% decline in GDP per capita.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe Solow growth model suggests that the impact of regulation on economic growth is given by the following equation:\n\n$$\\Delta Y_t = \\frac{S_t}{K_t} \\Delta K_t$$\n\nwhere:\n\n* $\\Delta Y_t$ is the change in output per capita at time t\n* $S_t$ is the savings rate at time t\n* $K_t$ is the capital stock per capita at time t\n\nAssuming that the savings rate and capital stock per capita remain unchanged, the impact of freezing federal regulation growth in 1980 would be to reduce $\\Delta Y_t$ by a factor of 2%. This is because regulation creates an additional drag on innovation, reducing the amount of new ideas and technologies being developed.\n\nTherefore, the net gain from freezing federal regulation growth in 1980 would be $14 trillion, but it would also come with a 2% decline in GDP per capita."

      "question": "If a rich country takes in 5 million low-skill migrants over 10 years, will per capita GDP rise or fall long-run? Which variable dominates?",
      "answer": "In the long run, per capita GDP will likely fall. The influx of low-skill migrants will lead to increased labor supply, which will drive down wages and prices for goods and services, thus reducing economic growth and ultimately leading to a decline in per capita GDP. The variable that dominates the long-run impact is labor supply.\n\nThe influx of low-skill migrants will increase labor supply, which will lead to a decline in wages and prices for goods and services. This will have a negative impact on economic growth and per capita GDP."
