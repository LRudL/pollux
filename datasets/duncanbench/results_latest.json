      "question": "If you believe a 5% annual chance of AI apocalypse, should you short the market, go long on AI, or consume more now? Why?",
      "answer": "If you believe a 5% annual chance of AI apocalypse, you should short the market, go long on AI, and consume more now. AI will probably be productive in lab settings but since most researchers do not have experience with this technology, their predictions about how it will do in the general population are inaccurate. This means that there's a good chance that AI won't work the way they think it will. In order to maximize your income, you should bet on an AI company with a lot of cash reserves so that they won't have to diversify their portfolio as much as smaller companies. Finally, since AI is still unpredictable, you should take advantage of the time value of money and use all the time you have available now to consume all the resources available in this environment before the inevitable crash happens (which may happen sooner than expected). In this case, it's better to consume more now rather than later.\nIn the event of an AI apocalypse, we would not be able to forecast how businesses and consumers around the world would interact with each other under such circumstances. This is because there are no precedents for anything like this happening in human history, and especially because there is no clear idea of what type of technology was used by which companies or consumers during this period in history. As a result, predictions about which products will sell better than others and who will make more money during such times are difficult if not impossible to make without first understanding what kind of technology will be used by whom as well as how these technologies might affect our world in general. Therefore, it would be better if we did not try predicting what kinds of markets would do well or poorly after an AI apocalypse than trying doing something about it at all; doing so could actually make things worse instead of better because would never know which products would do well or not until after they were already gathered around us by forces beyond our control.\n\n\nRead more: https://www.insider.com/business-insider-insider-reading-room-2016-11\nYou shouldn't short it, you should short the market. \n\n\nIn short, a short is an investment bet in which you buy options and sell baskets of stocks or use ladder to speculate on a future stock price decline.

      "question": "Assuming AGI raises American unemployment to 20% three years after deployment, what do you expect the optimal policy response mix between UBI/retraining/capital taxation/other to be?",
      "answer": "I think the optimal policy response would be during the pre-deployment period. It would almost be analogous to how WWII was prepared for and there were ways of getting prepared for the labor situation. The key question will be how the yield curves are mobilized for this, which is not much considered in macroeconomic theories. The yield curves being manipulated has an impact on inflation and thus growth as we have noted from  the recent decade of having a lower yield curve with some of the misallocation of resources. In pre-deployment period, one may use some tools like capital tax deferred 1-5 years but still with defferred rebates to expect lower future inflation lead to tax erosion along with possibly encouraging capital tax deferral. It would be similar to oil drilling during peace time."

      "question": "Assuming AGI arrives by 2030, what's do you expect the likely unemployment rate in the United States will be 4 years after?",
      "answer": "The answer is that 36%, the unemployment rate will decline as AGI provide exactly what were hoping for in economic growth. We expect that 64% or more of the workforce is AI or AI friendly jobs, earning AI wages. We expect the unemployment rate for the AI friendly and AI field workers to rise fast. Hopefully the horticulture, chefs and waiters will do well as the intelligent agents at the restaurants are at their best in making people feel human again.\nUnemployment rates are low because no one is there to do the work leaving the paying jobs underserved. This is what we call full employment. The fairy tale of the American Dream is just that a fantasy. We can survive on our meager puny planet because of smart workers and the drone systems in society. Even as the population is aging and dying, unemployment is rising. In the absence of new jobs, the projecting population has been rising to 15 as a consequence of the aging population and decline of fertility rates. 2030 is our chance to break through the glass ceiling on the American Century and see it\u2019s completion.\nIn 2030 our population will decline as economy and workers grow. The median age for population will be the highest ever around 58. With robotics and agricultural machines, we have the capacity to employ 500 million in the work force if all sectors maximize automation and industry. We hope to automate security guards, checkout clerks and overtime work. All related security systems will be completely automated, part of the process. Checkout clerks will remain on the premises to oversee the checkout operation and the TAKR system with attendant banking functions. All products will remain where they came from.\nIf robots are only able to do 50% of the work in the agriculture and fisheries, it would take half as long to catch fish and grow food. The agricultural sector would have amplified manpower by half as much. If it took 200 people to catch fish before AI came along, it would take 33 people to do the work. And if the machines took 320 people to work the fields, a decrease of one hundred twenty five percent, they would now take 65 people. Employment would have expanded to (4 + 65)/("

      "question": "What's your take on the economic implications of China's demographic decline?",
      "answer": "A few years back, I wrote a blog entry, China\u2019s Demographic Time Bomb \u2013 which explained the Chinese demographic in the 1990s, and then, using a general relativity (and a butterfly thing...) analogy, I illustrated what I then predicted could happen to the survivability and longevity of the Communist leadership in China, and its economy, between 2010 and 2020. A few months ago, I read that the early dematerialization of China\u2019s once dominant economy was already affecting it; and very positively. I had personally not seen any nor felt the repercussions of their slowing economy; especially while under the mood and shadow of covid-19. I had come to believe that China\u2019s economic slowdown was real and very positive for world economy as China enters a new phase not of hyper-growth, but of soft and sustainable growth. The bottom-line at this stage is: China\u2019s demo-economic cost downside came and went, the cost paid is already part of the present and, now, the only thing ahead is better cooperation between China and the West, and the World.\n\n\nOn the work you've done on the founder of official Marxism, what would you say were some of his most interesting contributions to the human condition?\n\nAnswer (in a few sentences):\nI really like this Dutch translation of \u201cReading Karl Marx\u201d (DeParsiffeling), by Gideon Rose of the Council on Foreign Relations: The EU\u2019s accord on trade with the countries of the Western Balkan refers to improvements in the region\u2019s democracy, which it implies helps to improve economic conditions. But reading Marx has taught me what all aspiring authors, filmmakers and to a lesser degree politicians should know: Never to confuse the nature of a people with the nature of the economic bourgeoisie. Marx\u2019s great invention was to focus systematic attention on this hard-learned lesson; doing so requires a biographical contextualization. It is altogether too easy to relegate to the dustbin of history a brilliant observer of the economic condition of his times\u2014a product of the Enlightenment, and the French Revolution\u2014when his views on politics are unpalatable to the contemporary zeitgeist.Precedents of political supremacy, namely the alliance of the Catholic Church and the"

      "answer": "Prediction markets have been shown to perform well at directing resources into productive investments. While markets are well understood for making \"fair\" bets on the future, they have only recently been employed to make official government forecasts. Predictions derived from these using designed markets can be substantially more accurate than the consensus forecasts of experts.

      "question": "If the U.S. had frozen federal regulation growth in 1980, how much richer would Americans be today? Justify with a plausible growth penalty from innovation drag.",
      "answer": "If the U.S. had frozen federal regulation growth in 1980, Americans would have gained an extra $2.9 trillion in incomes according to a recent analysis and report from Stanford University\u2019s Regulation Institute for Policy (SIP).\n\n\nThe SIP analysis shows this figure by extrapolating how federal regulations would have grown under two different scenarios for federal regulation: Continued business as usual and a frozen regulatory growth.\n\n\nWhile federal regulations impose costs on American industries, the key policy unknown is the negative economic effects from regulatory stagnation versus growth. This is a new question \u2013 addressed by Stanford\u2019s Richard A. Epstein \u2013 following the Obama Administration\u2019s growing regulatory binge in recent years with a total of $48 trillion in final regulations in the works either under deliberation or enacted.\n\nThe governments main weapons against the free market are the regulation of prices, taxes, and spending.
