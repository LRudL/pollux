Do negative potential effects of AI imply shorting the market?
In general, it's a very good sign to have skin in the game: to reflect your claims in your deeds. For instance, the AI safety movement worries about AI causing an enormous catastrophe in the near future. What would be skin-in-the-game for this position?
Tyler Cowen argues that the way for them to show their sincerity would be to short the market, since they expect huge damages from AI eventually. (He further implies that their not shorting the market makes light of the x-risk view.)
Others argue that those worried about xrisk should go long on AI-related stocks – since actually, if AI is to be powerful enough to cause catastrophe, related stocks will have incredible gains for some period before that. It also buys insurance.
Another way of betting your beliefs would be to increase your current consumption (since you don't expect to be able to realise investment gains).
And another is to zero out your retirement contributions, since you think you won’t get to draw down.
So, does a lack of “endurance to collect on [your] insurance” imply shorting the market? Note that this is not investment advice.
Model
To answer which approach is the best, we need to model a portfolio that allows us to test each option. In our portfolio, there is three assets: first, a risk-free bond, which gives us the return r; second, a risky AI stock, with a mean return of μ₁ and a standard deviation σ₁₁; and third, a risky non-AI stock, with a mean return of μ₂ and standard deviation σ₂₂.
We want to maximise our return, while minimising our risk, and so we can represent returns as the annual returns for every year in the future, discounted back into the present, and our risk aversion with respect to income1
U=∫t=0∞(1−ρ)tct1−η1−η
Finally, provided that the two stocks are not perfectly correlated, we should reduce our portfolio risk by owning some of both of them. The more uncorrelated the two stocks are (correlation is measured by σ₂₁), the more we would like to spread between them (holding returns constant). This means that the equation to calculate our optimal holdings and consumption looks like this:
πt∗=1ηΩ−1(μ−r)=(σ222(μ1−r)−σ21(μ2−r)η(σ11σ22−σ212),σ112(μ2−r)−σ21(μ1−r)η(σ11σ22−σ212))
Ct∗=ρη−(1−η)((μ−r)′Ω−1(μ−r)2η2+rη)
Several things immediately appear. Firstly, the optimal portfolio is independent of discounting - so high estimates of doom do not suppress stock holdings. This is because as the mean return and standard deviation of stocks doesn’t change across time, the risk profile of any given allocation is time-invariant - so you don’t want to change your desired portfolio if you start valuing the future more or less vs the present.2
Secondly, if covariance is negative and both risky assets return more than bonds, optimal holdings of non-AI stock are always positive. This is because negative covariance means risk can be reduced by holding at least some of each stock, and the second condition means doing so is a better deal than bonds. 
Thirdly, although optimal consumption is increasing in both discounting and expected returns, η determines the relative degree of each - under low levels of risk aversion expected returns have no effect (η = 1), while under high levels mortality is greatly suppressed in importance.
Parameter estimation
High estimates of doom are theoretically compatible with high estimates of covariance though - so we need to establish upper bounds of individual’s beliefs on this to check whether any set of beliefs could justify shorting the market.  
μ₁: The mean return of AI stock. Under Manifold’s, a prediction market, estimates for when OpenAI firms reaches a $1trn valuation (current valuation: $150bn), expected returns would be 52%/year if valuation growth was monotonic and the firm was worthless if it never reached $1trn. However, Manifold also estimates a 62% chance at least one of OpenAI and Anthropic drop below their current value by 2030 and 34% OpenAI no longer exists by 2030. Many of these trades are on very low volume markets, but if Anthropic and OpenAI are equally likely to no longer exist and have reached a valuation of $1trn at one point in half of those worlds, then this implies a 44% mean return.3
Of course, OpenAI and Anthropic aren’t available to buy in public markets. What is the maximum the heavy-AI public portfolio could return?
If Deepmind was valued at $100bn, given Alphabet’s $2.1trn valuation this only raises returns by 5.6% to 2035. If chip manufacturers can capture 10% of additional value created - noting that this would be 4x the AI firms themselves - this would given Nvidia, TSMC and ASML’s combined valuation of $4.42trn boost their returns by 14.7% to 2030. If they capture as much, this again falls down to 5.5%. The 5.5% excess return (so 15.5% total return) will be used here.4
σ₁₁: Standard deviation of AI stock return. In each of the above cases the standard deviation was 1.02 and 0.46 respectively.5
μ₂: Non-AI stock return. 10%. 
σ₂₂: Non-AI stock standard deviation. 15%.
σ₂₁: Covariance. This could be negative due to direct AI damage (including existential risk), or automation or similar effects increasing output but displacing existing firms. As noted above, to the extent that this is true optimal stock holdings are positive. Positive covariance could be driven by positive innovation spillovers to the rest of the market. Firms in general capture 2.2% of the value they create, boosting average returns over the next 10 years by 12.4% in the narrow specification, or by 0.6% in the broad specification.6
r : Risk free rate. 5%.
ρ: Pure time preference discount rate. 2%. 
η: Relative risk aversion. 2.
Results
Most importantly, non-AI stock holdings are always positive, and increase as covariance declines - so higher estimates of damages do not imply shorting the market. This is because if the stocks have negative covariance, they serve as a hedge against each other - a hedge which is more valuable the greater the expected return from AI.
The differences in consumption suggested in the table above are very small. This is because wealth growth rates don’t differ much across scenarios - in the optimal allocation, the additional income from access to very high-return AI stocks is used mostly to buy safe returns rather than increasing income. Higher wealth growth rates are then cancelled out by higher portfolio variance, which makes wealth more important as a risk-hedging tool.
What about existential risk pushing up discounting and thus consumption?
Optimal consumption is high enough in all these models any such effect to be undetectable for most individuals. For someone with 40 years of working life remaining discounting at 3% (5% less 2% income growth), their income flow is already only 4.2% of lifetime wealth - so they are credit constrained, desiring to borrow more at the risk free rate but unable to do so. Income only crosses 5.7% of remaining lifetime wealth 24 years before work concludes, so in an individual’s early 40s.7
Discussion
There are several issues in general with applying this kind of portfolio model - most wealth for most individuals are in future wages not assets lowering optimal leverage, investment returns do not follow a normal distribution raising optimal lecture, etc. In this setting several other effects manifest.
If existential risk is high, AI stocks are a better deal than modelled here - bankruptcy options are much more valuable with high variance assets. However, if nationalisation or political risk is higher if returns are high then returns are overestimated. Also, AI-induced technology could also introduce new goods, lowering effective η- if air conditioning is invented, you have something else valuable to spend higher levels of income on, so marginal utility declines less as you become richer - scaling investment choices proportionately. 
Discount rates are probably correlated with AI returns, as mortality risk may be higher if the technology is coming along more quickly; discounting doesn’t affect optimal portfolios, but consumption could change. Very rapid increases in wealth could also increase asset holdings amongst the old (who have converted more of their human to financial capital), or increase asset holdings for those with lower discount rates so have saved more historically, and so could have systemic effects on future premia. 
Lastly, these estimates don’t account for transition dynamics. To upper bound this, if (unpriced) mortality is 50% over the next 30 years, then annual mortality is 2.3%, implying a 30% price reduction. If society realised this over 10 years, returns fall by 4.8% - falling to close to bond levels. If covariance is negative, then optimal non-AI stock holdings will certainly remain positive; in the baseline broad specification stock holdings remain positive at 7.1%. Hoping to profit off of transition dynamics thus cannot justify shorting the market overall.  
Conclusion
As Tyler Cowen argued in a later Marginal Revolution post, finance theory is indeed non-obvious, and there are returns to doing the sums. Those with higher appraisals of AI risk want to hold more non-AI stocks, not fewer, as non-AI stocks then provide a more effective hedge against the failure of the high-return AI firms - and in no cases modelled here do individuals wish to short the market. Higher discounting could justify higher consumption - but the faster rate of economic growth AI could enable does not, over the short term. Forseeing any potential apocalypse generally cannot make you much money in a way that you care about.

Discounting is the process of valuing money you will receive in the future. Being promised £100 in 5 years would be preferable to being promised £100 in 20 years, even beyond being able to save it etc. Discounting is how we represent this.
2
It does suppress stock prices (due to higher interest rates being applied on the same stream of profits) though - we consider this effect below.
3
Other relevant markets: 32% chance OpenAI >$1trn by 2030, 42% >$1trn by 2034, and 66% OpenAI is worth >$300bn by mid-2026.
4
There are other mechanisms that could potentially give some exposure to AI stock growth, such as providing power or cloud infrastructure for the labs; these are probably less effective at capturing value than owning the labs directly, and as the existing assets measured are already 5% of the stock market they will not be considered here.
5
This violates Merton’s model assumptions of constant returns over time - returns grow asymptotically to the growth rate of the highest component. Only considering returns over the next decade is roughly reasonable given the high stated discount rates of the individuals this post is modelling the rationality of though.
6
Why can the 2.2% figure be used, when the short-run fraction of profits captured is 7.8%? Other firm valuations will increase in response to greater expected future profits; as the 2.2% is the present value portion, the corresponding adjustment will be immediately reflected in other firms prices.
7
Individuals of that age still rationally hold savings, but primarily due to other credit market imperfections.
","Cool thanks for writing this up!

One extension to bring this closer to people's model of AI risk is to have a time T where there's a chance that utility goes to zero (AI takeover) or a person gets a one-time utility boost from the capital they have left (i.e. their money buys them some amount of expected utility in a post-singularity future).

I think you would end up with a Merton-like portfolio for the time leading up to T with some cash saved for after the singularity.
","If you are certain about the time when singularity/doom occurs, this becomes the finite-horizon version of the Merton model. However, given that there is presumably some uncertainty as to when/if a singularity with occur, you'll need to discount at some rate to represent your uncertainty - which as you note leads to the same portfolio as in the post but higher consumption.

","This... assumes there is no consumption? Or that you can't spend money now to reduce risk later??

Overall I don't understand what's going on here.

> the optimal portfolio is independent of discounting - so high estimates of doom do not suppress stock holdings

I don't understand why. Could you say a bit more about the intuition here?
","The model includes consumption - it just doesn't rise in response to the changes in expected income growth here because almost all of the rise in income growth is used to buy safety rather than higher returns (the average annual rate of return on the portfolios just goes from 11% to 13%), as the new assets while higher return are also much higher variance. In general, the new AI stocks introduced are too high variance relative to the market as a whole for an individual to want to short the market and use the funds to buy either AI stocks or bonds.

The optimal portfolio would depend on discounting if either optimal holdings varied by wealth level (so how much you cared about now vs the richer future mattered) or if you'd have preferred the past invested differently.

The first of these isn't the case because the utility function has constant relative risk aversion - which means that, for any level of wealth, an individual will always pick the same choice between options:

1) Probability p wealth rises by x%, probability 1-p wealth changes by y%

2) Wealth changes by guaranteed z%

For given x,y,z,p regardless of their wealth. Given normal distribution's of returns, their optimal risk choice stays constant regardless of their expected level of wealth.

The second of these isn't the case either, because consumption and investment decisions are separable in the model. Although you would today prefer your past self to have consumed less, you wouldn't like them to have invested differently (because optimal investments don't depend on wealth or any other characteristic that would have changed) - so with neither of these the case, your optimal portfolio is independent of your discount rate.

Existing fertility interventions are (probably) well worth it
Humanity has a fertility problem. Birth rates are near or below replacement in all but the world’s poorest countries – and falling rapidly. Without a change in projected population trajectory (or AI timelines), humanity could have less than a century of current-level innovation left, forever.
What can we do? In the short term, countries will try to encourage immigration – see Japan’s recent liberalisation of immigration rules. But, fertility is falling everywhere. We might then try relying on the traditional driver of population growth over the past century, namely the lower mortality rates from economic growth and medical advancements. However, the gains from this approach have been exhausted. People rarely die before reaching the age at which they would have stopped having children.1

So, we’re left with trying to encourage more births, or removing barriers that exist currently. More people are good. Not only are they capable of leading happy lives (a philosophical position), but they have ideas, and innovate. However, it is not immediately clear if we, like good economists, should subsidise this positive externality. This is because, bar some sophisticated (and politically difficult) targeting, we’ll have to subsidise all births, including those that would’ve happened anyway. 
In this post, we show that under the median estimated elasticity the socially optimal fertility rate is 2.4 in the US, well above today’s 1.7, given that the US should place a value of 14.28x GDP/capita per additional birth ($1.17mn per birth). Furthermore, to achieve this, the US should be willing to spend the equivalent of 3.8% of its GDP ($290K per birth) on fertility subsidies. For context, the existing child tax credit is worth $2000/year, or $26K present value. We’d like to stress that these figures are highly uncertain, because of both the varying welfare gain from more births, and also varying estimates of how effective subsidising births are. Even still, in the main case, the US government should seriously consider greatly increasing its child tax credits, and explore more creative and ambitious solutions to address this looming demographic crisis. 
How much should we be willing to pay for an additional birth? 
There are probably four reasons why you should care about increasing fertility rates: public goods (the fixed cost for public goods are spread across more productive people), externalities from research (more people, more ideas!), life cycle effects (the young can help the old) and altruism (we care about the happiness of future generations).
Firstly, more people, more ideas. Ideas have been the driver of economic growth, and people are the driver of ideas. And ideas are ‘non-rival’ - if we invent a better way to grow wheat, it doesn’t matter whether the technique is used by 100 people, or a million. To figure out how valuable these new people and their ideas are, we work out the value of the worlds where they did and did not exist. There are a couple of considerations we need to make these calculations. However, the quality and quantity of ideas (as measured by their economic contribution) does not increase in direct proportion to the number of people. They suffer from diminishing returns which means we should multiply each additional person’s output by 0.75. Because we’re only concerned with the US, using the contributions of scientists to published research as a proxy for total contribution to scientific output, the US accounts for only 26% of global science output.2  We must also remember that the new births are children, and so we should apply a discount factor of 0.82.3 The Economist, arguing against the subsidies we model, noted that only 8% of children of parents without college education will get a college degree, compared to 62% of all parents. However, even if we fully account for this, this still yields a $1.03m (around 12.67xGDP/capita) willingness to pay for any given birth from just their research contributions.4
Now we also should add the additional benefit from spreading the fixed cost for public goods, eg. on defence or public debt, across more people. Such public goods are “non-rival”, which means that they don’t get worse for existing users if more people use them. As a result, if we increase births, we increase the number of people who can pay for them, and hence reduce costs for existing users. For the US, we model just the military and public debt, subtracting climate change. The US devotes 3.4% GDP to the military and has debt worth 122% of GDP. And, how about increasing birth’s effects on climate change? Well, though the aggregate costs of climate change increase faster than the population, it’s not by much, with an elasticity of 1.18.5 When we consider this with a 3.5% discount rate the present value decarbonisation expenses are equivalent to 23% GDP for purposes here, overall resulting in the 1.96xGDP gains from the other public good effects, which we also discount by 0.82. 
Next, higher fertility means younger people. In the medium term, this results in higher taxes per capita. Unfortunately, we don’t have good figures of the marginal government spending over a lifetime by age. Both caring for the elderly and educating children are expensive - so we don’t know what the net effect will be, because the elderly are much more expensive per person, but their costs are also far in the future. We’ll leave this out of our calculations for now. 
Finally, we’ll briefly consider the “full altruism” case, ie. one where we also value the raw happiness enjoyed by these new people. A life is worth much more than a total lifetime income.6 We get this from considering the statistical value of life, currently $13m, which is much higher than expected lifetime income. This yields a 164x GDP in the US. We don’t include this number for our baseline estimates – whether or not to do so philosophically controversial - but do present results if this utilised.
Model
Now that we have society’s “willingness to pay” for an additional birth, we need to estimate how responsive fertility is to a subsidy. 
Suppose that fertility, n, has a constant elasticity to the private value of having a child, so takes the form:
n=n0(1+sv)μ
Given that the policymaker places social externality k (calculated above) and private value v on each birth, they will try to maximise:
(k+v−s)(1+sv)μ
This solves to
s∗=μk−v(1−μ)μ+1
Which means that, with the optimal subsidy, fertility will increase to:
n∗=n0(μμ+1)μ(2+kv)μ
We can therefore see that the condition for this subsidy being greater than zero is that the elasticity needs to be greater than the private value over the social value, or: 
μ>vk+v
Quickly estimating the rest of the parameters:
v is the perceived value of raising a child. On the margin, this will equal the perceived cost of raising a child. In the US, this was $233,000 in 2017, or 3.88. 
mu is the elasticity. This literature review estimates that the elasticity of fertility to a payment equivalent to 1% of income is between 0.04-0.3. We then need to multiply this by 3.88, because we’re interested in the elasticity to the private valuation v, getting 0.15 to 1.16, with median estimate 0.51.
Results and discussion

We find that, for any intervention, the elasticity for fertility needs to exceed 0.27 – if you only care about the research and public goods externalities. This means that most existing interventions would be well worth the money if implemented in the US.78 While the recommended payments are substantial, if US borrowing isn’t too large a share of overall capital markets then the large size of these payments won’t pose a problem.9
We should also note that our estimates are a static, not dynamic model, meaning that our estimates are conservative. If we consider the world where, as a result of this policy, the population itself increases – and this causes many of the effects we model (both positive and negative) to change as well. Because, under our estimates, the positive effects likely increase by much more than the negative, a dynamic model of this policy means that we should be even more willing to pay for more births.10
The other effect that we do not include is the welfare gains from the non-marginal parent who now gets a free subsidy for children they would’ve had anyway, and are now strictly better off. We treat their welfare gain from this as zero, and so overestimate the costs.
One billion Americans
We conclude that the US government should be willing to pay up to $290,000, overall, to each parent who gives birth. This is a result of our model that shows that any new child born, that wouldn’t otherwise have been born without the subsidy, has a $1.17mn value to the US. In practice, suggestions for additional child tax credits from across the aisle should be implemented, and perhaps even greatly increased. 
Because there is a huge range of elasticity estimates in the literature, there is only so much confidence we can ascribe to any policy implications. Existing interventions aren’t well studied. And we’re interested in the best interventions, not the average ones. Society should invest more resources in studying fertility interventions worldwide, and coming up with new ones: subsidising fertility treatment, reforming child care regulation, changing cultural norms. 
For this post, though, in many senses, we’ve modelled the worst case. That these subsidies are non-targeted, while in practice, we can do much better. That more young people won’t improve the demographic structure of the economy, while in practice, it will. That society doesn’t account for the happiness of the new children themselves, while in practice, we do. 
Humanity has a fertility problem. But it’s a solvable one.

Unintuitively, increases in the growth rate of life expectancy only have level effects on population, as long as life expectancy growth remains below 1 year/year. This is because increases in life expectancy don’t result in additional births from individuals of childbearing age surviving when they would instead have died, but instead lower the mortality of individuals beyond it.
2
 We’ll assume that research output flows perfectly across borders; due to patents often being recognised internationally this will lead to a slight underestimate of the gains.
3
Children aren’t immediately productive, but have more years of working life remaining than the median American, so it is prima facie unclear whether they will be more or less productive. Under a 3.5% discount rate, the net effect is to render their present value 82% of average at birth. 
4
This is likely a large underestimate of the research potential of the additional births induced; some individuals with higher educational levels will respond to the incentives, while comparative advantage will ensure that even if the assumptions about who will be incentivised were correct research output would still rise.
5
Global per capita costs of climate change would rise from $471 to $481 in the event of a rise in the global population from 8.7bn to 9.7bn.
6
Because the happiness that a person diminishes from increased income, so you value your “previous” consumption more than you paid for it in your marginal consumption.
7
It doesn’t necessarily follow from this that the interventions were worthwhile in the countries in which they were conducted: as the benefits in this model are almost entirely driven by research externalities, and a country’s incentive to do this scales with size, fertility interventions in very small countries may not have paid off.
8
 In the long-run, the standard model for fertility, the Barro-Becker model, would predict that when the cost of children falls, people will have more children. However, they’ll have so many more children, they’ll give each less of an inheritance, and this’ll result in their incomes decreasing so much that the resulting reduction of children that they’ll in turn have will have decreased have so much that overall they would’ve had as many children as if the decline had never occurred. In short, the subsidy would only have boosted births one time, and births would fall by as much if it was withdrawn.
The empirical fit of the model without extensive modifications is dubious though - it predicts very large dependence of fertility on interest rates, and struggles to yield a declining crude birth rate in response to falls in infant mortality. 
9
If the US accounted for a very large share of global borrowing, then if payments became large as a fraction of GDP then diminishing marginal utility of income would reduce willingness to pay, as although additional children would continue to bring large benefits the current consumption traded off against it would become increasingly costly. However, future productivity gains can be borrowed against to avoid a reduction in living standards today. 
10
Research externalities rise quickly with population; climate change rises slowly and public goods benefits fall slowly with it, but the population could double from its present level and the public goods - climate term would remain positive, while the research term would double. Importantly, under a higher population reaching above replacement fertility could be optimal while it previously was not - policymakers would be willing to spend on short-run-negative subsidies as with the higher population new possibilities would be opened.
","This is a terrifying article -- not just because it is dead wrong, but because it represents the petrified state of economic scholarship. At a time when humanity desperately needs economic systems that can address the mess we've made of the modern world, economists still blindly ignore externalities (pollution, health effects, climate impacts), wasteful inefficiencies (plastic waste in the oceans and now microplastics in our brains), the impacts of runaway inequality, the loss of wildlife (down 70% in 50 years) and wildlife habitat, etc.

The authors are eager for new ideas from the yet-to-be-born while producing no new ideas that solve any of these problems. Circular economies, donut economics and other models need more attention, have one characteristic that is lost on traditional economists -- they echo the patterns of nature itself, which seeks to maximize efficiency and minimize waste as a fundamental part of each of its designs. In an age of unprecedented technological innovation, sclerotic economic thinking denies the possibility of vastly enhanced productivity methods that smaller working sectors might use to support their top-heavy population of elders. It's a math problem, and one that needs serious attention.

Finally, you don't need math to see the horrors of modern life. Drive any crumbling traffic-choked four-lane highway past endless parking lots filled with massive vehicles used by consumer-addicts to buy more stuff to hoard into their pricey housing units, and you see a vast panorama of the widespread high anxiety unhappiness of contemporary American life. Humans can't even manage the populations we have now, even in the richest parts of the world -- or the inevitability of food and water shortages to come, as climate change finally works itself into the attention of world leaders, and economists. Of course, by then it will be too late.
","We include estimates of the effects of climate change in our estimates of the net subsidy; in order to demonstrate that our estimates are insufficient you would need to show some combination of 1) climate damages rise much faster in population than we estimate (for the marginal value of a birth to be negative for an average utilitarian the climate elasticity would need to exceed 8.7 vs the 1.18 we use) or 2) optimal annual climate change mitigation spending + damages much exceed 4.4% of GDP (specifically it would need to be 189% i.e. you also need to show some large elasticity differences regardless).

Existing fertility interventions are (probably) well worth it
Humanity has a fertility problem. Birth rates are near or below replacement in all but the world’s poorest countries – and falling rapidly. Without a change in projected population trajectory (or AI timelines), humanity could have less than a century of current-level innovation left, forever.
What can we do? In the short term, countries will try to encourage immigration – see Japan’s recent liberalisation of immigration rules. But, fertility is falling everywhere. We might then try relying on the traditional driver of population growth over the past century, namely the lower mortality rates from economic growth and medical advancements. However, the gains from this approach have been exhausted. People rarely die before reaching the age at which they would have stopped having children.1

So, we’re left with trying to encourage more births, or removing barriers that exist currently. More people are good. Not only are they capable of leading happy lives (a philosophical position), but they have ideas, and innovate. However, it is not immediately clear if we, like good economists, should subsidise this positive externality. This is because, bar some sophisticated (and politically difficult) targeting, we’ll have to subsidise all births, including those that would’ve happened anyway. 
In this post, we show that under the median estimated elasticity the socially optimal fertility rate is 2.4 in the US, well above today’s 1.7, given that the US should place a value of 14.28x GDP/capita per additional birth ($1.17mn per birth). Furthermore, to achieve this, the US should be willing to spend the equivalent of 3.8% of its GDP ($290K per birth) on fertility subsidies. For context, the existing child tax credit is worth $2000/year, or $26K present value. We’d like to stress that these figures are highly uncertain, because of both the varying welfare gain from more births, and also varying estimates of how effective subsidising births are. Even still, in the main case, the US government should seriously consider greatly increasing its child tax credits, and explore more creative and ambitious solutions to address this looming demographic crisis. 
How much should we be willing to pay for an additional birth? 
There are probably four reasons why you should care about increasing fertility rates: public goods (the fixed cost for public goods are spread across more productive people), externalities from research (more people, more ideas!), life cycle effects (the young can help the old) and altruism (we care about the happiness of future generations).
Firstly, more people, more ideas. Ideas have been the driver of economic growth, and people are the driver of ideas. And ideas are ‘non-rival’ - if we invent a better way to grow wheat, it doesn’t matter whether the technique is used by 100 people, or a million. To figure out how valuable these new people and their ideas are, we work out the value of the worlds where they did and did not exist. There are a couple of considerations we need to make these calculations. However, the quality and quantity of ideas (as measured by their economic contribution) does not increase in direct proportion to the number of people. They suffer from diminishing returns which means we should multiply each additional person’s output by 0.75. Because we’re only concerned with the US, using the contributions of scientists to published research as a proxy for total contribution to scientific output, the US accounts for only 26% of global science output.2  We must also remember that the new births are children, and so we should apply a discount factor of 0.82.3 The Economist, arguing against the subsidies we model, noted that only 8% of children of parents without college education will get a college degree, compared to 62% of all parents. However, even if we fully account for this, this still yields a $1.03m (around 12.67xGDP/capita) willingness to pay for any given birth from just their research contributions.4
Now we also should add the additional benefit from spreading the fixed cost for public goods, eg. on defence or public debt, across more people. Such public goods are “non-rival”, which means that they don’t get worse for existing users if more people use them. As a result, if we increase births, we increase the number of people who can pay for them, and hence reduce costs for existing users. For the US, we model just the military and public debt, subtracting climate change. The US devotes 3.4% GDP to the military and has debt worth 122% of GDP. And, how about increasing birth’s effects on climate change? Well, though the aggregate costs of climate change increase faster than the population, it’s not by much, with an elasticity of 1.18.5 When we consider this with a 3.5% discount rate the present value decarbonisation expenses are equivalent to 23% GDP for purposes here, overall resulting in the 1.96xGDP gains from the other public good effects, which we also discount by 0.82. 
Next, higher fertility means younger people. In the medium term, this results in higher taxes per capita. Unfortunately, we don’t have good figures of the marginal government spending over a lifetime by age. Both caring for the elderly and educating children are expensive - so we don’t know what the net effect will be, because the elderly are much more expensive per person, but their costs are also far in the future. We’ll leave this out of our calculations for now. 
Finally, we’ll briefly consider the “full altruism” case, ie. one where we also value the raw happiness enjoyed by these new people. A life is worth much more than a total lifetime income.6 We get this from considering the statistical value of life, currently $13m, which is much higher than expected lifetime income. This yields a 164x GDP in the US. We don’t include this number for our baseline estimates – whether or not to do so philosophically controversial - but do present results if this utilised.
Model
Now that we have society’s “willingness to pay” for an additional birth, we need to estimate how responsive fertility is to a subsidy. 
Suppose that fertility, n, has a constant elasticity to the private value of having a child, so takes the form:
n=n0(1+sv)μ
Given that the policymaker places social externality k (calculated above) and private value v on each birth, they will try to maximise:
(k+v−s)(1+sv)μ
This solves to
s∗=μk−v(1−μ)μ+1
Which means that, with the optimal subsidy, fertility will increase to:
n∗=n0(μμ+1)μ(2+kv)μ
We can therefore see that the condition for this subsidy being greater than zero is that the elasticity needs to be greater than the private value over the social value, or: 
μ>vk+v
Quickly estimating the rest of the parameters:
v is the perceived value of raising a child. On the margin, this will equal the perceived cost of raising a child. In the US, this was $233,000 in 2017, or 3.88. 
mu is the elasticity. This literature review estimates that the elasticity of fertility to a payment equivalent to 1% of income is between 0.04-0.3. We then need to multiply this by 3.88, because we’re interested in the elasticity to the private valuation v, getting 0.15 to 1.16, with median estimate 0.51.
Results and discussion

We find that, for any intervention, the elasticity for fertility needs to exceed 0.27 – if you only care about the research and public goods externalities. This means that most existing interventions would be well worth the money if implemented in the US.78 While the recommended payments are substantial, if US borrowing isn’t too large a share of overall capital markets then the large size of these payments won’t pose a problem.9
We should also note that our estimates are a static, not dynamic model, meaning that our estimates are conservative. If we consider the world where, as a result of this policy, the population itself increases – and this causes many of the effects we model (both positive and negative) to change as well. Because, under our estimates, the positive effects likely increase by much more than the negative, a dynamic model of this policy means that we should be even more willing to pay for more births.10
The other effect that we do not include is the welfare gains from the non-marginal parent who now gets a free subsidy for children they would’ve had anyway, and are now strictly better off. We treat their welfare gain from this as zero, and so overestimate the costs.
One billion Americans
We conclude that the US government should be willing to pay up to $290,000, overall, to each parent who gives birth. This is a result of our model that shows that any new child born, that wouldn’t otherwise have been born without the subsidy, has a $1.17mn value to the US.

","This post does a good job of defending natalism, but as an anti-natalist, here's where I disagree:

1. There is no discussion of research into extending birth-span, meaning, the age at which women can give birth. Currently, the average age of infertility for women is 35. With science, we should be able to extend this to 45, which would significantly improve the birth rate. The benefit of this policy is that it wouldn't be a ""cash for babies"" incentive, which is dysgenic (poor people are more incentivized by ""cash for babies"" than rich people.) If we are going to spend $290k million on each new baby, or 3% of GDP, why not instead spend that money on researching birth-span? It would have similar quantitative results (more births), but different qualitative ones (less dysgenic incentives).

2. The article makes no mention of pollution. Chemicals make us dumb, and more people means more chemicals. Therefore, overpopulation leads to a global decline in IQ, which means less innovation.

3. The articles uses Japan as an example of a country which is trying to liberalize its immigration policies, but is failing. This is largely because Japan is a (relatively) poor and xenophobic society. It would be much cheaper to import more immigrants (open borders) than to pay people $290k to have babies.
","1. This post was intended as an answer to the question ""would the bluntest instrument possible work"" - and it seems that the answer is yes. There are likely many other more cost effective solutions that should be tried in addition to large subsidies - with the increase in birth-span you mention especially promising as almost all of the births covered are marginal. However, conditional on the $1.2mn value it still seems likely some (pretty hefty) subsidies are optimal - especially as (due to increasing returns from technological innovation) the marginal value of a birth is rising in expected cohort size!

2. As far as I'm aware, most pollutants at the concentrations in developed countries today have extremely limited effects on IQ - correcting for sample selection, even lead has quite limited impacts (although substantial effects on mortality etc, so is still well worth removing). Are there other pollutants you were thinking of/could you provide specific numbers for their effects?

3. The point wasn't about whether Japan was succeeding or failing, but rather that as fertility is falling everywhere more migrants would help make up falling native births on the margin, in the medium term global fertility will pass below 2, and we'll need to come up with some way to raise it above 2 again to avoid the global population falling. Subsidies are a blunt instrument, but the point of this analysis was to suggest that they would work, and be worth paying for.

If the US accounted for a very large share of global borrowing, then if payments became large as a fraction of GDP then diminishing marginal utility of income would reduce willingness to pay, as although additional children would continue to bring large benefits the current consumption traded off against it would become increasingly costly. However, future productivity gains can be borrowed against to avoid a reduction in living standards today.

Research externalities rise quickly with population; climate change rises slowly and public goods benefits fall slowly with it, but the population could double from its present level and the public goods - climate term would remain positive, while the research term would double. Importantly, under a higher population reaching above replacement fertility could be optimal while it previously was not - policymakers would be willing to spend on short-run-negative subsidies as with the higher population new possibilities would be opened.

","This proposal is optimal fertility subsidies for the US; it has no effect on educational resources per capita elsewhere. Transfers to developing countries to improve their ability to contribute to science are very much desirable today, but will also likely reduce (global) fertility rates further and so further increase the benefits to boosting fertility in any specific jurisdiction, ceteris paribus.

Existing fertility interventions are (probably) well worth it
Humanity has a fertility problem. Birth rates are near or below replacement in all but the world’s poorest countries – and falling rapidly. Without a change in projected population trajectory (or AI timelines), humanity could have less than a century of current-level innovation left, forever.
What can we do? In the short term, countries will try to encourage immigration – see Japan’s recent liberalisation of immigration rules. But, fertility is falling everywhere. We might then try relying on the traditional driver of population growth over the past century, namely the lower mortality rates from economic growth and medical advancements. However, the gains from this approach have been exhausted. People rarely die before reaching the age at which they would have stopped having children.1

So, we’re left with trying to encourage more births, or removing barriers that exist currently. More people are good. Not only are they capable of leading happy lives (a philosophical position), but they have ideas, and innovate. However, it is not immediately clear if we, like good economists, should subsidise this positive externality. This is because, bar some sophisticated (and politically difficult) targeting, we’ll have to subsidise all births, including those that would’ve happened anyway. 
In this post, we show that under the median estimated elasticity the socially optimal fertility rate is 2.4 in the US, well above today’s 1.7, given that the US should place a value of 14.28x GDP/capita per additional birth ($1.17mn per birth). Furthermore, to achieve this, the US should be willing to spend the equivalent of 3.8% of its GDP ($290K per birth) on fertility subsidies. For context, the existing child tax credit is worth $2000/year, or $26K present value. We’d like to stress that these figures are highly uncertain, because of both the varying welfare gain from more births, and also varying estimates of how effective subsidising births are. Even still, in the main case, the US government should seriously consider greatly increasing its child tax credits, and explore more creative and ambitious solutions to address this looming demographic crisis. 
How much should we be willing to pay for an additional birth? 
There are probably four reasons why you should care about increasing fertility rates: public goods (the fixed cost for public goods are spread across more productive people), externalities from research (more people, more ideas!), life cycle effects (the young can help the old) and altruism (we care about the happiness of future generations).
Firstly, more people, more ideas. Ideas have been the driver of economic growth, and people are the driver of ideas. And ideas are ‘non-rival’ - if we invent a better way to grow wheat, it doesn’t matter whether the technique is used by 100 people, or a million. To figure out how valuable these new people and their ideas are, we work out the value of the worlds where they did and did not exist. There are a couple of considerations we need to make these calculations. However, the quality and quantity of ideas (as measured by their economic contribution) does not increase in direct proportion to the number of people. They suffer from diminishing returns which means we should multiply each additional person’s output by 0.75. Because we’re only concerned with the US, using the contributions of scientists to published research as a proxy for total contribution to scientific output, the US accounts for only 26% of global science output.2  We must also remember that the new births are children, and so we should apply a discount factor of 0.82.3 The Economist, arguing against the subsidies we model, noted that only 8% of children of parents without college education will get a college degree, compared to 62% of all parents. However, even if we fully account for this, this still yields a $1.03m (around 12.67xGDP/capita) willingness to pay for any given birth from just their research contributions.4
Now we also should add the additional benefit from spreading the fixed cost for public goods, eg. on defence or public debt, across more people. Such public goods are “non-rival”, which means that they don’t get worse for existing users if more people use them. As a result, if we increase births, we increase the number of people who can pay for them, and hence reduce costs for existing users. For the US, we model just the military and public debt, subtracting climate change. The US devotes 3.4% GDP to the military and has debt worth 122% of GDP. And, how about increasing birth’s effects on climate change? Well, though the aggregate costs of climate change increase faster than the population, it’s not by much, with an elasticity of 1.18.5 When we consider this with a 3.5% discount rate the present value decarbonisation expenses are equivalent to 23% GDP for purposes here, overall resulting in the 1.96xGDP gains from the other public good effects, which we also discount by 0.82. 
Next, higher fertility means younger people. In the medium term, this results in higher taxes per capita. Unfortunately, we don’t have good figures of the marginal government spending over a lifetime by age. Both caring for the elderly and educating children are expensive - so we don’t know what the net effect will be, because the elderly are much more expensive per person, but their costs are also far in the future. We’ll leave this out of our calculations for now. 
Finally, we’ll briefly consider the “full altruism” case, ie. one where we also value the raw happiness enjoyed by these new people. A life is worth much more than a total lifetime income.6 We get this from considering the statistical value of life, currently $13m, which is much higher than expected lifetime income. This yields a 164x GDP in the US. We don’t include this number for our baseline estimates – whether or not to do so philosophically controversial - but do present results if this utilised.
Model
Now that we have society’s “willingness to pay” for an additional birth, we need to estimate how responsive fertility is to a subsidy. 
Suppose that fertility, n, has a constant elasticity to the private value of having a child, so takes the form:
n=n0(1+sv)μ
Given that the policymaker places social externality k (calculated above) and private value v on each birth, they will try to maximise:
(k+v−s)(1+sv)μ
This solves to
s∗=μk−v(1−μ)μ+1
Which means that, with the optimal subsidy, fertility will increase to:
n∗=n0(μμ+1)μ(2+kv)μ
We can therefore see that the condition for this subsidy being greater than zero is that the elasticity needs to be greater than the private value over the social value, or: 
μ>vk+v
Quickly estimating the rest of the parameters:
v is the perceived value of raising a child. On the margin, this will equal the perceived cost of raising a child. In the US, this was $233,000 in 2017, or 3.88. 
mu is the elasticity. This literature review estimates that the elasticity of fertility to a payment equivalent to 1% of income is between 0.04-0.3. We then need to multiply this by 3.88, because we’re interested in the elasticity to the private valuation v, getting 0.15 to 1.16, with median estimate 0.51.
Results and discussion

We find that, for any intervention, the elasticity for fertility needs to exceed 0.27 – if you only care about the research and public goods externalities. This means that most existing interventions would be well worth the money if implemented in the US.78 While the recommended payments are substantial, if US borrowing isn’t too large a share of overall capital markets then the large size of these payments won’t pose a problem.9
We should also note that our estimates are a static, not dynamic model, meaning that our estimates are conservative. If we consider the world where, as a result of this policy, the population itself increases – and this causes many of the effects we model (both positive and negative) to change as well. Because, under our estimates, the positive effects likely increase by much more than the negative, a dynamic model of this policy means that we should be even more willing to pay for more births.10
The other effect that we do not include is the welfare gains from the non-marginal parent who now gets a free subsidy for children they would’ve had anyway, and are now strictly better off. We treat their welfare gain from this as zero, and so overestimate the costs.
One billion Americans
We conclude that the US government should be willing to pay up to $290,000, overall, to each parent who gives birth. This is a result of our model that shows that any new child born, that wouldn’t otherwise have been born without the subsidy, has a $1.17mn value to the US. In practice, suggestions for additional child tax credits from across the aisle should be implemented, and perhaps even greatly increased. 
Because there is a huge range of elasticity estimates in the literature, there is only so much confidence we can ascribe to any policy implications. Existing interventions aren’t well studied. And we’re interested in the best interventions, not the average ones. Society should invest more resources in studying fertility interventions worldwide, and coming up with new ones: subsidising fertility treatment, reforming child care regulation, changing cultural norms. 
For this post, though, in many senses, we’ve modelled the worst case. That these subsidies are non-targeted, while in practice, we can do much better. That more young people won’t improve the demographic structure of the economy, while in practice, it will. That society doesn’t account for the happiness of the new children themselves, while in practice, we do. 
Humanity has a fertility problem. But it’s a solvable one.
1
Unintuitively, increases in the growth rate of life expectancy only have level effects on population, as long as life expectancy growth remains below 1 year/year. This is because increases in life expectancy don’t result in additional births from individuals of childbearing age surviving when they would instead have died, but instead lower the mortality of individuals beyond it.
2
 We’ll assume that research output flows perfectly across borders; due to patents often being recognised internationally this will lead to a slight underestimate of the gains.
3
Children aren’t immediately productive, but have more years of working life remaining than the median American, so it is prima facie unclear whether they will be more or less productive. Under a 3.5% discount rate, the net effect is to render their present value 82% of average at birth. 
4
This is likely a large underestimate of the research potential of the additional births induced; some individuals with higher educational levels will respond to the incentives, while comparative advantage will ensure that even if the assumptions about who will be incentivised were correct research output would still rise.
5
Global per capita costs of climate change would rise from $471 to $481 in the event of a rise in the global population from 8.7bn to 9.7bn.
6
Because the happiness that a person diminishes from increased income, so you value your “previous” consumption more than you paid for it in your marginal consumption.
7
It doesn’t necessarily follow from this that the interventions were worthwhile in the countries in which they were conducted: as the benefits in this model are almost entirely driven by research externalities, and a country’s incentive to do this scales with size, fertility interventions in very small countries may not have paid off.
8
 In the long-run, the standard model for fertility, the Barro-Becker model, would predict that when the cost of children falls, people will have more children. However, they’ll have so many more children, they’ll give each less of an inheritance, and this’ll result in their incomes decreasing so much that the resulting reduction of children that they’ll in turn have will have decreased have so much that overall they would’ve had as many children as if the decline had never occurred. In short, the subsidy would only have boosted births one time, and births would fall by as much if it was withdrawn.
The empirical fit of the model without extensive modifications is dubious though - it predicts very large dependence of fertility on interest rates, and struggles to yield a declining crude birth rate in response to falls in infant mortality. 
9
If the US accounted for a very large share of global borrowing, then if payments became large as a fraction of GDP then diminishing marginal utility of income would reduce willingness to pay, as although additional children would continue to bring large benefits the current consumption traded off against it would become increasingly costly. However, future productivity gains can be borrowed against to avoid a reduction in living standards today. 
10
Research externalities rise quickly with population; climate change rises slowly and public goods benefits fall slowly with it, but the population could double from its present level and the public goods - climate term would remain positive, while the research term would double. Importantly, under a higher population reaching above replacement fertility could be optimal while it previously was not - policymakers would be willing to spend on short-run-negative subsidies as with the higher population new possibilities would be opened.
","I am generally all for more people, as I agree with the assertion, ""more people are good."" But a thought that I had while reading this was that if we were to successfully increase fertility via subsidy to the optimal rate, there would likely be adverse effects for the first generation that are born at that rate. Will there be enough spots at top colleges to maximize those who would normally contribute some great idea? Will there be enough jobs to support a massive influx of entry level workers? If not, I fear we could end up in a situation like Italy or Greece, with high levels of youth unemployment and unrest.
","The absolute increases in fertility discussed here aren't titanic - cohort size would only rise by 39%. Supply should be sufficiently elastic for most services to accommodate this - and importantly firms and public bodies would have 2 decades or more in advance to prepare.

An outlandish proposal to solve the housing crisis

Housing in Britain is unaffordable. The average British home costs 9.1 times median earnings to purchase - the highest since the unification of Germany - and rents are 27% of pre-tax monthly income in England as a whole, and 35% in London. For all this, Britons get homes that are smaller than in New York and demolished so infrequently that equilibrium entails an average house age over 1350 years old.
As many note, this is overwhelmingly due to Britain’s bloated planning restrictions. For example, in London, these restrictions essentially ban building in an area three times larger than the city itself, while very heavily restricting construction within its borders. We have previously estimated, conservatively, such restrictions cost 6% of GDP a year. Yet, they have endured largely because existing residents don’t want the inconvenience of housing construction and increased population density more broadly.
Well, if the difficulty is existing residents, we have a Wales-sized solution. Dogger Bank. 

A new green and pleasant land (adapted from Wikipedia)
Dogger Bank has a perimeter of 720 km and area of 17,600 km2, compared to Wales’ 20,600km2. It’s almost entirely within Britain’s territorial waters (sorry Germany). And it's only 15-40 m below sea level to boot - so at depths humanity has constructed large engineering projects before. 
Headline results: we estimate raising Dogger Bank would cost £97.5bn, but would bring present value benefits of £622bn. Under the government’s standard method of cost-benefit analysis, this project would get a go-ahead, with a cost-benefit ratio of 6.2.
Methodology
What exactly is involved in reclaiming land?
Well, a layman’s guide to land reclamation:
Build a wall around the area you want to reclaim.
Pump out the water.1
Fill it up with your desired material. 2
Develop.
To estimate the costs for Dogger Bank, we’ll simply add up the costs for each section.
Build A Wall 

Dutch Wall: (and keep the foreign water out)

They say God created the world but the Dutch created the Netherlands
There are only two comparable projects of this scale, the Dutch “Oosterscheldekering” and South Korean “Saemangeum.” The Oosterscheldekering is a series of 65 concrete walls each 40m tall that form 9km of the Dutch Coastline. The project was completed in 10 years, from 1976-1986 at a cost of £6bn. The Saemangeum was much cheaper, a 33km seawall built in 2010, at an average height of 36m, at the cost of £1.94bn. 
Using the South Korean numbers, which are both more modern and closer to the size of our project, we calculate that building a 720km seawall will cost £76.1bn. This, conservatively, considers that all costs, such as transportation and labour, scale at a similar rate to UK wages compared to 1998 Korean ones - increasing by 86%. We also adjust downwards to account for economies of scale, additional efficiencies gained from this large project size, adapting our figures from the equivalent measures in homebuilding, where a 100-fold increase in project size reduces price per unit by 20.5%. 
To check our work, we compared this seawall cost to the proposed 700km North European Enclosure Dam (NEED), which the literature estimates will be in the range of £250bn-500bn.3 This corresponds with our results, because for comparable lengths, NEED requires construction at much greater depths, up to 300m in the deepest parts, compared to a maximum depth of 40m for DoggerBank.
Pump Out The Water
Delightfully, the Pump Express company publishes the costs to pump water using centrifugal pumps. For us, we calculate that we’re going need around 7.16mn CP230, their most cost-efficient model that can pump water high enough, which will cost £1150 per machine. 
Unfortunately, the ground is leaky. This makes for a fun optimisation problem. If we assume that water seeps back into the area of ~1% a day, it turns out the cost-minimising solution involves keeping those 7.16mn of those machines on for 107 days, assuming an electricity cost of 9p/kwh, at 50% efficiency. This yields a total cost for this step of £12.1bn. 
Fill It In
We’ll need to fill 634 cubic kilometers, meaning that we’ll need 2 gigatons of rock – this accounts for the 10-30% increase in volume required because the rock must be compacted. Using open quarries at a typical rate of $5/tonne, this will cost £7.9bn (or perhaps a great volume of dynamite and some less picturesque Welsh mountains). To transport these 2 gigatons, we’ll use commercial shipping and trucking rates of £1.22/tonne/1000km and £4.77/tonne/1000km respectively. This gives us a total to fill in Dogger Bank of £9.3bn. 
Dogger Bank Reclaimed
Concluding, this gives a total construction cost of £97.5bn across the three steps, or 4.3% of UK GDP.4 That’s about as much as the full HS2. 
Development
At the moment, DoggerBank is a barren piece of land in the North Sea, even wetter and windier than the mainland. We’re going to need some infrastructure.
We can split this calculation into two parts:
Infrastructure paid for by the end user, such as ports, reservoirs, power generation and telecommunications – which we don’t calculate because will be covered privately
And infrastructure provided by the government, think schools, hospitals and roads. 
Based on our prior estimates, schools and hospitals cost £2277 and £2588 per capita, respectively. Underground lines in London cost £9100 per capita, but using Madrid's cut-and-cover method before house construction, costs can be reduced to less than a tenth per kilometer. Fares at London levels should drive net costs to zero.
Per capita costs will be factored into house prices. Roads cost £1194/capita (based on a £4bn maintenance budget, 5% discount rate). Courthouses and prisons have capital expenditure totaling £567/capita (assuming all capital spending is for building maintenance). Police and fire stations, managed locally, cost £19/capita and £51/capita respectively (based on Essex Police and North Yorkshire figures, including all capital expenditure).
The total budget is £6129 per capita, which translates to an implied cost of £14,464 per household (average size: 2.36 people). 
Benefits
We’ll use our adaptation of Hsieh and Moretti 2019 to estimate the implied benefits. See our housing paper for all parameter estimates not undertaken here, and for a more detailed exposition of the model used. 

Table 1: Assumptions by calculation. *Without buildable envelope changes changes in PED have no effect in this model.
We'll make several improvements to our previous calibration.
We remove the variation in construction project size, as this will be a new city that can be constructed in larger chunks, assuming each is £100mn in size (the limit of the data).
We now allow increases in buildable envelope, considering that in London today, 2.27x as much space is used on residential gardens as on residential buildings, and more space is used on private gardens than residential buildings in all but 5 of the 33 boroughs. These gardens add relatively little value to properties, so they would be removed by a free market.
Price index convergence is no longer relevant as all possible houses are built in the same region – we instead assume that all homes will be built at the combined London index.
As construction will occur upon a completely flat area the size of Wales over a 40-year period (the length under which the mobility assumptions are computed), there is little reason to expect prices to vary with quantity. Therefore, the Price Elasticity of Supply (PES) will be assumed to be infinite in all cases.
Levies are lower for reasons explained later, albeit calculated more comprehensively.
We retain the 8-storey assumption as this minimizes prices under our estimated price levels.
Project construction time will also vary, as this affects the present discounted value of undertaking it. The envisioned construction techniques should scale roughly linearly to time spent, making a 5-year construction schedule plausible. However, 20 and 40 years will be assumed for the central and conservative cases, respectively.
The most important change compared to the previous model is the inclusion of land prices, which is necessary to model cases other than merely increasing density. In the conservative case, we copy existing land prices wholesale, albeit under the retained assumption from the previous model of average building heights of 8 storeys, up from a presumed average height of 3 storeys in London and 2 storeys in the rest of the country.
For the central and stretch cases, we consider two additional effects from a possible increase in buildable envelope:
A direct effect of spreading land price over a greater number of homes, reducing unit costs.
An indirect effect of reducing prices through demand-curve effects.
Findlay and Gibb (1994) report that estimates of housing's price demand elasticity vary in the literature from -0.5 to -0.8. Assuming this maps onto land, we'll use the implied estimates of changes in land price.

Table 2: Estimated rents for the new city by assumptions - “recreating Birmingham” in this model means both having West Midlands housing construction prices estimated here and current wages. The North East shows no variation due to actual house prices being below predicted construction prices, with this being a result of falling populations causing a temporary disequilibrium.
An area the size of Wales could generate economic activity beyond the cities located nearby. While potential mining or energy industries will be ignored, changes in territorial waters related to North Sea oil and gas could lead to substantial effects in the energy sector.
Agriculture, however, could produce more significant effects. Arable land is valued at £9,272/acre, or £2.3 million/km2. The proposed city would have population densities 2.7 to 5.3 times higher than present-day London, so even with the size of London it would only operate 3.3% of the island. The remaining agricultural land would then generate £38.97 billion worth of agricultural land as a one-time benefit, equal to 1.7% of GDP.
To calculate the value of these changes, we will adopt the British government's approach of using a 1% real long-run discount rate. For the sake of brevity, only imperfect mobility results will be reported, as perfect mobility results would be higher. It will be assumed that housing benefits from migration accumulate linearly over the 40-year period corresponding to the imperfect mobility coefficient.

Table 3: GDP gains under imperfect mobility, new city has productivity of London

Table 4: GDP gains under imperfect mobility, new city has productivity of Bracknell
We present the results for London and Reading and Bracknell, the two most productive Travel To Work Areas (TTWAs) in the UK. The results for all cities more productive than Birmingham are roughly similar, within a range of approximately ±25%, to those of Reading and Bracknell. However, for cities less productive than Birmingham, the model yields much lower values that typically do not pass a cost-benefit ratio.5
The results in this analysis vary much less across specifications compared to our earlier work. This is because the rent variation across different scenarios is much smaller, and the price elasticity of supply is no longer relevant for topographical reasons, leading to smaller changes in migration as well. However, the estimated GDP gains under imperfect mobility are much larger; this occurs because the model assumes decreasing returns to scale due to land constraints, so creating a new London with relaxed restrictions is considerably more valuable than relaxing restrictions in present London. It is important to note that the results are applicable for a wide range of plausible productivities that are high enough to justify the scheme. 
Discussion
We present the costs of complete reclamation for Doggerbank for illustrative purposes only. An area much smaller than the size of Wales would be initially needed for any likely city construction program. London's current size is 8.9% of the proposed reclaimed area, and Singapore's is 4.2%. As costs for the wall decline with the square root of size, the cost-benefit ratio could be substantially improved compared to the value presented here, with agricultural benefits constituting only a small fraction of the total.
However, the project's success is based on the ability to continually grow a city to a size comparable to current cities. If the same British residents who currently oppose housing construction in existing cities move in, they may force the city to stagnate at a much lower size.
The project would be at little risk from sea level rises, as above-ground sea walls are generally inexpensive, costing only £700-£5400/m2 with low maintenance costs. Building a sea wall around the entire project would thus add at most 4% to the capital cost.
There is a possibility that this project could damage marine ecosystems, but it is likely less than any land-based construction. Oceans contain around 200 times less biomass than land per unit area on average, although this figure is likely higher for the North Sea compared to most oceans due to closer proximity to coastlines. Additionally, the project avoids the usual costs associated with land reclamation proposals, as it does not require large quantities of sand. It will only disrupt extant marine ecosystems in the quantity of seawater now occupied by the newest constituent nation of the UK, not elsewhere.
Conclusion
As with Mankiw and Weinzierl 2009’s famous study of optimal height taxation, there are two possible ways to interpret this post. The first is a simple reductio ad absurdum argument against current land use regulations - the planning system means that the British government would receive a greater than 6-fold return from reclaiming an area the size of Wales from the North Sea. The second is that it is a perfectly sensible suggestion similar to existing policies to circumvent NIMBYs in other areas - just as we escape the planning system’s strictures on wind farms by building them offshore, we can do the same for cities. We leave the correct choice as an exercise for the reader.

Due to backflow, you need to pump more than you think, because water will seep back underground.
2
1.1-1.3x, because you need to compact it.
3
Cowen’s Second Law!
4
These estimated costs per unit area are around 100x smaller than the average figure for Singaporean land reclamation - this likely mostly derives from most of the cost in this model coming from the sea wall, which has a price per unit area directly proportional to the square root of project size, so the much smaller scale Singaporean efforts are enormously more costly. Additionally, by employing very expensive sand rather than crushed rock their costs rise further.
5
Specifically, the other sufficiently productive cities are Cambridge, Oxford, Wycombe & Slough, Guildford & Aldershot, Stevenage and Bristol.","Why build a wall and pump? Just start dumping rocks at the center in the planned volume or a few % more to account for subsidence at the edges to the known angle of repose. Voila, your land mass for less. And it would be quicker - probably done by next April Fools' Day.

","Thanks for the suggestion - we did consider this, but our current understanding is that just dumping material (during current much smaller scale land reclamation projects) tends to leave the reclaimed land highly vulnerable to erosion, meaning that the land would quickly shrink (while the referenced Dutch wall should last for >200 years). Specifically, extrapolating from the rate of erosion between Flamborough and Spurn Heads (https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/a-map-of-europes-fastest-eroding-coast/ - and the soil here would likely be even weaker) the island would shrink by ~1.5%/year, and presumably faster at the surface, which seems much too high for stability. We do agree that the wall section assembly would likely form most of the construction time though.

This, conservatively, considers that all costs, such as transportation and labour, scale at a similar rate to UK wages compared to 1998 Korean ones - increasing by 86%. We also adjust downwards to account for economies of scale, additional efficiencies gained from this large project size, adapting our figures from the equivalent measures in homebuilding, where a 100-fold increase in project size reduces price per unit by 20.5%. 
To check our work, we compared this seawall cost to the proposed 700km North European Enclosure Dam (NEED), which the literature estimates will be in the range of £250bn-500bn.3 This corresponds with our results, because for comparable lengths, NEED requires construction at much greater depths, up to 300m in the deepest parts, compared to a maximum depth of 40m for DoggerBank.
Pump Out The Water
Delightfully, the Pump Express company publishes the costs to pump water using centrifugal pumps. For us, we calculate that we’re going need around 7.16mn CP230, their most cost-efficient model that can pump water high enough, which will cost £1150 per machine. 
Unfortunately, the ground is leaky. This makes for a fun optimisation problem. If we assume that water seeps back into the area of ~1% a day, it turns out the cost-minimising solution involves keeping those 7.16mn of those machines on for 107 days, assuming an electricity cost of 9p/kwh, at 50% efficiency. This yields a total cost for this step of £12.1bn. 
Fill It In
We’ll need to fill 634 cubic kilometers, meaning that we’ll need 2 gigatons of rock – this accounts for the 10-30% increase in volume required because the rock must be compacted. Using open quarries at a typical rate of $5/tonne, this will cost £7.9bn (or perhaps a great volume of dynamite and some less picturesque Welsh mountains). To transport these 2 gigatons, we’ll use commercial shipping and trucking rates of £1.22/tonne/1000km and £4.77/tonne/1000km respectively. This gives us a total to fill in Dogger Bank of £9.3bn. 
Dogger Bank Reclaimed
Concluding, this gives a total construction cost of £97.5bn across the three steps, or 4.3% of UK GDP.4 That’s about as much as the full HS2. 
Development
At the moment, DoggerBank is a barren piece of land in the North Sea, even wetter and windier than the mainland. We’re going to need some infrastructure.
We can split this calculation into two parts:
Infrastructure paid for by the end user, such as ports, reservoirs, power generation and telecommunications – which we don’t calculate because will be covered privately
And infrastructure provided by the government, think schools, hospitals and roads. 
Based on our prior estimates, schools and hospitals cost £2277 and £2588 per capita, respectively. Underground lines in London cost £9100 per capita, but using Madrid's cut-and-cover method before house construction, costs can be reduced to less than a tenth per kilometer. Fares at London levels should drive net costs to zero.
Per capita costs will be factored into house prices. Roads cost £1194/capita (based on a £4bn maintenance budget, 5% discount rate). Courthouses and prisons have capital expenditure totaling £567/capita (assuming all capital spending is for building maintenance). Police and fire stations, managed locally, cost £19/capita and £51/capita respectively (based on Essex Police and North Yorkshire figures, including all capital expenditure).
The total budget is £6129 per capita, which translates to an implied cost of £14,464 per household (average size: 2.36 people). 
Benefits
We’ll use our adaptation of Hsieh and Moretti 2019 to estimate the implied benefits. See our housing paper for all parameter estimates not undertaken here, and for a more detailed exposition of the model used. 

Table 1: Assumptions by calculation. *Without buildable envelope changes changes in PED have no effect in this model.
We'll make several improvements to our previous calibration.
We remove the variation in construction project size, as this will be a new city that can be constructed in larger chunks, assuming each is £100mn in size (the limit of the data).
We now allow increases in buildable envelope, considering that in London today, 2.27x as much space is used on residential gardens as on residential buildings, and more space is used on private gardens than residential buildings in all but 5 of the 33 boroughs. These gardens add relatively little value to properties, so they would be removed by a free market.
Price index convergence is no longer relevant as all possible houses are built in the same region – we instead assume that all homes will be built at the combined London index.
As construction will occur upon a completely flat area the size of Wales over a 40-year period (the length under which the mobility assumptions are computed), there is little reason to expect prices to vary with quantity. Therefore, the Price Elasticity of Supply (PES) will be assumed to be infinite in all cases.
Levies are lower for reasons explained later, albeit calculated more comprehensively.
We retain the 8-storey assumption as this minimizes prices under our estimated price levels.
Project construction time will also vary, as this affects the present discounted value of undertaking it. The envisioned construction techniques should scale roughly linearly to time spent, making a 5-year construction schedule plausible. However, 20 and 40 years will be assumed for the central and conservative cases, respectively.
The most important change compared to the previous model is the inclusion of land prices, which is necessary to model cases other than merely increasing density. In the conservative case, we copy existing land prices wholesale, albeit under the retained assumption from the previous model of average building heights of 8 storeys, up from a presumed average height of 3 storeys in London and 2 storeys in the rest of the country.
For the central and stretch cases, we consider two additional effects from a possible increase in buildable envelope:
A direct effect of spreading land price over a greater number of homes, reducing unit costs.
An indirect effect of reducing prices through demand-curve effects.
Findlay and Gibb (1994) report that estimates of housing's price demand elasticity vary in the literature from -0.5 to -0.8. Assuming this maps onto land, we'll use the implied estimates of changes in land price.

Table 2: Estimated rents for the new city by assumptions - “recreating Birmingham” in this model means both having West Midlands housing construction prices estimated here and current wages. The North East shows no variation due to actual house prices being below predicted construction prices, with this being a result of falling populations causing a temporary disequilibrium.
An area the size of Wales could generate economic activity beyond the cities located nearby. While potential mining or energy industries will be ignored, changes in territorial waters related to North Sea oil and gas could lead to substantial effects in the energy sector.
Agriculture, however, could produce more significant effects. Arable land is valued at £9,272/acre, or £2.3 million/km2. The proposed city would have population densities 2.7 to 5.3 times higher than present-day London, so even with the size of London it would only operate 3.3% of the island. The remaining agricultural land would then generate £38.97 billion worth of agricultural land as a one-time benefit, equal to 1.7% of GDP.
To calculate the value of these changes, we will adopt the British government's approach of using a 1% real long-run discount rate. For the sake of brevity, only imperfect mobility results will be reported, as perfect mobility results would be higher. It will be assumed that housing benefits from migration accumulate linearly over the 40-year period corresponding to the imperfect mobility coefficient.

Table 3: GDP gains under imperfect mobility, new city has productivity of London

Table 4: GDP gains under imperfect mobility, new city has productivity of Bracknell
We present the results for London and Reading and Bracknell, the two most productive Travel To Work Areas (TTWAs) in the UK. The results for all cities more productive than Birmingham are roughly similar, within a range of approximately ±25%, to those of Reading and Bracknell. However, for cities less productive than Birmingham, the model yields much lower values that typically do not pass a cost-benefit ratio.5
The results in this analysis vary much less across specifications compared to our earlier work. This is because the rent variation across different scenarios is much smaller, and the price elasticity of supply is no longer relevant for topographical reasons, leading to smaller changes in migration as well. However, the estimated GDP gains under imperfect mobility are much larger; this occurs because the model assumes decreasing returns to scale due to land constraints, so creating a new London with relaxed restrictions is considerably more valuable than relaxing restrictions in present London. It is important to note that the results are applicable for a wide range of plausible productivities that are high enough to justify the scheme. 
Discussion
We present the costs of complete reclamation for Doggerbank for illustrative purposes only. An area much smaller than the size of Wales would be initially needed for any likely city construction program. London's current size is 8.9% of the proposed reclaimed area, and Singapore's is 4.2%. As costs for the wall decline with the square root of size, the cost-benefit ratio could be substantially improved compared to the value presented here, with agricultural benefits constituting only a small fraction of the total.
However, the project's success is based on the ability to continually grow a city to a size comparable to current cities. If the same British residents who currently oppose housing construction in existing cities move in, they may force the city to stagnate at a much lower size.
The project would be at little risk from sea level rises, as above-ground sea walls are generally inexpensive, costing only £700-£5400/m2 with low maintenance costs. Building a sea wall around the entire project would thus add at most 4% to the capital cost.
There is a possibility that this project could damage marine ecosystems, but it is likely less than any land-based construction. Oceans contain around 200 times less biomass than land per unit area on average, although this figure is likely higher for the North Sea compared to most oceans due to closer proximity to coastlines. Additionally, the project avoids the usual costs associated with land reclamation proposals, as it does not require large quantities of sand. It will only disrupt extant marine ecosystems in the quantity of seawater now occupied by the newest constituent nation of the UK, not elsewhere.
Conclusion
As with Mankiw and Weinzierl 2009’s famous study of optimal height taxation, there are two possible ways to interpret this post. The first is a simple reductio ad absurdum argument against current land use regulations - the planning system means that the British government would receive a greater than 6-fold return from reclaiming an area the size of Wales from the North Sea. The second is that it is a perfectly sensible suggestion similar to existing policies to circumvent NIMBYs in other areas - just as we escape the planning system’s strictures on wind farms by building them offshore, we can do the same for cities. We leave the correct choice as an exercise for the reader.

Due to backflow, you need to pump more than you think, because water will seep back underground.
2
1.1-1.3x, because you need to compact it.
3
Cowen’s Second Law!
4
These estimated costs per unit area are around 100x smaller than the average figure for Singaporean land reclamation - this likely mostly derives from most of the cost in this model coming from the sea wall, which has a price per unit area directly proportional to the square root of project size, so the much smaller scale Singaporean efforts are enormously more costly. Additionally, by employing very expensive sand rather than crushed rock their costs rise further.
5
Specifically, the other sufficiently productive cities are Cambridge, Oxford, Wycombe & Slough, Guildford & Aldershot, Stevenage and Bristol.","I don't understand why you need to fill in crushed rock or sand. Just build the wall and be done? the entire area would be below sea level but that's not unheard of: The lowest spot in the Netherlands being nearly 7 m below sea level.

Guessing you'd have to keep pumping anyway. A question is how long it would take for rain input to turn water bodies from salt- to freshwater.

PS Understandable but shame to have it as an April Fool's thing. Seems sensible to me. An instance of pushback against innovation starvation (Neal Stephenson's phrase).
","Under the cost estimates we have in the article, it would be substantially cheaper to fill it in - cost of doing so is only 9% of the total cost, compared to 12% from merely having the pumps active for 100 days - of which half is the cost of the backflow during that length of time. We now think our backflow estimates were probably too high (especially as rain seems to be a substantial portion of the water ingress in similar projects), but it remains the case that it seems that managing to avoid pumping altogether after filling has begun would probably be cheaper on net.

","Thanks, great explanation!

If backflow is lower that's great news for wanting fewer pumps that you'd never need to use again (unless maybe for a next project) after the intial drainage phase. Don't quite see though how the optimization works out to want to do it so quick: My logic says as long as you pump faster than backflow it'll eventually empty out. So the minimum number of pumps to maintain a narrow surplus should be optimal? Understood its *desirable* to not let it take too long.

","We include electricity costs in the cost of pumping at current UK market prices (due to proximity to wind we might be able to do this slightly cheaper), so it does minimise total expenses to do it at the calculated rate (and these do end up as a substantial portion of the total at the optimal choice). Optimal rate will necessarily be slightly faster than this due to including the delay on benefits from longer construction times etc.

An outlandish proposal to solve the housing crisis

Housing in Britain is unaffordable. The average British home costs 9.1 times median earnings to purchase - the highest since the unification of Germany - and rents are 27% of pre-tax monthly income in England as a whole, and 35% in London. For all this, Britons get homes that are smaller than in New York and demolished so infrequently that equilibrium entails an average house age over 1350 years old.
As many note, this is overwhelmingly due to Britain’s bloated planning restrictions. For example, in London, these restrictions essentially ban building in an area three times larger than the city itself, while very heavily restricting construction within its borders. We have previously estimated, conservatively, such restrictions cost 6% of GDP a year. Yet, they have endured largely because existing residents don’t want the inconvenience of housing construction and increased population density more broadly.
Well, if the difficulty is existing residents, we have a Wales-sized solution. Dogger Bank. 

A new green and pleasant land (adapted from Wikipedia)
Dogger Bank has a perimeter of 720 km and area of 17,600 km2, compared to Wales’ 20,600km2. It’s almost entirely within Britain’s territorial waters (sorry Germany). And it's only 15-40 m below sea level to boot - so at depths humanity has constructed large engineering projects before. 
Headline results: we estimate raising Dogger Bank would cost £97.5bn, but would bring present value benefits of £622bn. Under the government’s standard method of cost-benefit analysis, this project would get a go-ahead, with a cost-benefit ratio of 6.2.
Methodology
What exactly is involved in reclaiming land?
Well, a layman’s guide to land reclamation:
Build a wall around the area you want to reclaim.
Pump out the water.1
Fill it up with your desired material. 2
Develop.
To estimate the costs for Dogger Bank, we’ll simply add up the costs for each section.
Build A Wall 

Dutch Wall: (and keep the foreign water out)

They say God created the world but the Dutch created the Netherlands
There are only two comparable projects of this scale, the Dutch “Oosterscheldekering” and South Korean “Saemangeum.” The Oosterscheldekering is a series of 65 concrete walls each 40m tall that form 9km of the Dutch Coastline. The project was completed in 10 years, from 1976-1986 at a cost of £6bn. The Saemangeum was much cheaper, a 33km seawall built in 2010, at an average height of 36m, at the cost of £1.94bn.

If we assume that water seeps back into the area of ~1% a day, it turns out the cost-minimising solution involves keeping those 7.16mn of those machines on for 107 days, assuming an electricity cost of 9p/kwh, at 50% efficiency. This yields a total cost for this step of £12.1bn. 
Fill It In
We’ll need to fill 634 cubic kilometers, meaning that we’ll need 2 gigatons of rock – this accounts for the 10-30% increase in volume required because the rock must be compacted. Using open quarries at a typical rate of $5/tonne, this will cost £7.9bn (or perhaps a great volume of dynamite and some less picturesque Welsh mountains). To transport these 2 gigatons, we’ll use commercial shipping and trucking rates of £1.22/tonne/1000km and £4.77/tonne/1000km respectively. This gives us a total to fill in Dogger Bank of £9.3bn. 
Dogger Bank Reclaimed
Concluding, this gives a total construction cost of £97.5bn across the three steps, or 4.3% of UK GDP.4 That’s about as much as the full HS2. 
Development
At the moment, DoggerBank is a barren piece of land in the North Sea, even wetter and windier than the mainland. We’re going to need some infrastructure.
We can split this calculation into two parts:
Infrastructure paid for by the end user, such as ports, reservoirs, power generation and telecommunications – which we don’t calculate because will be covered privately
And infrastructure provided by the government, think schools, hospitals and roads. 
Based on our prior estimates, schools and hospitals cost £2277 and £2588 per capita, respectively. Underground lines in London cost £9100 per capita, but using Madrid's cut-and-cover method before house construction, costs can be reduced to less than a tenth per kilometer. Fares at London levels should drive net costs to zero.
Per capita costs will be factored into house prices. Roads cost £1194/capita (based on a £4bn maintenance budget, 5% discount rate). Courthouses and prisons have capital expenditure totaling £567/capita (assuming all capital spending is for building maintenance). Police and fire stations, managed locally, cost £19/capita and £51/capita respectively (based on Essex Police and North Yorkshire figures, including all capital expenditure).
The total budget is £6129 per capita, which translates to an implied cost of £14,464 per household (average size: 2.36 people). 
Benefits
We’ll use our adaptation of Hsieh and Moretti 2019 to estimate the implied benefits. See our housing paper for all parameter estimates not undertaken here, and for a more detailed exposition of the model used. 

Table 1: Assumptions by calculation. *Without buildable envelope changes changes in PED have no effect in this model.
We'll make several improvements to our previous calibration.
We remove the variation in construction project size, as this will be a new city that can be constructed in larger chunks, assuming each is £100mn in size (the limit of the data).
We now allow increases in buildable envelope, considering that in London today, 2.27x as much space is used on residential gardens as on residential buildings, and more space is used on private gardens than residential buildings in all but 5 of the 33 boroughs. These gardens add relatively little value to properties, so they would be removed by a free market.
Price index convergence is no longer relevant as all possible houses are built in the same region – we instead assume that all homes will be built at the combined London index.
As construction will occur upon a completely flat area the size of Wales over a 40-year period (the length under which the mobility assumptions are computed), there is little reason to expect prices to vary with quantity. Therefore, the Price Elasticity of Supply (PES) will be assumed to be infinite in all cases.
Levies are lower for reasons explained later, albeit calculated more comprehensively.
We retain the 8-storey assumption as this minimizes prices under our estimated price levels.
Project construction time will also vary, as this affects the present discounted value of undertaking it. The envisioned construction techniques should scale roughly linearly to time spent, making a 5-year construction schedule plausible. However, 20 and 40 years will be assumed for the central and conservative cases, respectively.
The most important change compared to the previous model is the inclusion of land prices, which is necessary to model cases other than merely increasing density. In the conservative case, we copy existing land prices wholesale, albeit under the retained assumption from the previous model of average building heights of 8 storeys, up from a presumed average height of 3 storeys in London and 2 storeys in the rest of the country.
For the central and stretch cases, we consider two additional effects from a possible increase in buildable envelope:
A direct effect of spreading land price over a greater number of homes, reducing unit costs.
An indirect effect of reducing prices through demand-curve effects.
Findlay and Gibb (1994) report that estimates of housing's price demand elasticity vary in the literature from -0.5 to -0.8. Assuming this maps onto land, we'll use the implied estimates of changes in land price.

Table 2: Estimated rents for the new city by assumptions - “recreating Birmingham” in this model means both having West Midlands housing construction prices estimated here and current wages. The North East shows no variation due to actual house prices being below predicted construction prices, with this being a result of falling populations causing a temporary disequilibrium.
An area the size of Wales could generate economic activity beyond the cities located nearby. While potential mining or energy industries will be ignored, changes in territorial waters related to North Sea oil and gas could lead to substantial effects in the energy sector.
Agriculture, however, could produce more significant effects. Arable land is valued at £9,272/acre, or £2.3 million/km2. The proposed city would have population densities 2.7 to 5.3 times higher than present-day London, so even with the size of London it would only operate 3.3% of the island. The remaining agricultural land would then generate £38.97 billion worth of agricultural land as a one-time benefit, equal to 1.7% of GDP.
To calculate the value of these changes, we will adopt the British government's approach of using a 1% real long-run discount rate. For the sake of brevity, only imperfect mobility results will be reported, as perfect mobility results would be higher. It will be assumed that housing benefits from migration accumulate linearly over the 40-year period corresponding to the imperfect mobility coefficient.

Table 3: GDP gains under imperfect mobility, new city has productivity of London

Table 4: GDP gains under imperfect mobility, new city has productivity of Bracknell
We present the results for London and Reading and Bracknell, the two most productive Travel To Work Areas (TTWAs) in the UK. The results for all cities more productive than Birmingham are roughly similar, within a range of approximately ±25%, to those of Reading and Bracknell. However, for cities less productive than Birmingham, the model yields much lower values that typically do not pass a cost-benefit ratio.5
The results in this analysis vary much less across specifications compared to our earlier work. This is because the rent variation across different scenarios is much smaller, and the price elasticity of supply is no longer relevant for topographical reasons, leading to smaller changes in migration as well. However, the estimated GDP gains under imperfect mobility are much larger; this occurs because the model assumes decreasing returns to scale due to land constraints, so creating a new London with relaxed restrictions is considerably more valuable than relaxing restrictions in present London. It is important to note that the results are applicable for a wide range of plausible productivities that are high enough to justify the scheme. 
Discussion
We present the costs of complete reclamation for Doggerbank for illustrative purposes only. An area much smaller than the size of Wales would be initially needed for any likely city construction program. London's current size is 8.9% of the proposed reclaimed area, and Singapore's is 4.2%. As costs for the wall decline with the square root of size, the cost-benefit ratio could be substantially improved compared to the value presented here, with agricultural benefits constituting only a small fraction of the total.
However, the project's success is based on the ability to continually grow a city to a size comparable to current cities. If the same British residents who currently oppose housing construction in existing cities move in, they may force the city to stagnate at a much lower size.
The project would be at little risk from sea level rises, as above-ground sea walls are generally inexpensive, costing only £700-£5400/m2 with low maintenance costs. Building a sea wall around the entire project would thus add at most 4% to the capital cost.
There is a possibility that this project could damage marine ecosystems, but it is likely less than any land-based construction. Oceans contain around 200 times less biomass than land per unit area on average, although this figure is likely higher for the North Sea compared to most oceans due to closer proximity to coastlines. Additionally, the project avoids the usual costs associated with land reclamation proposals, as it does not require large quantities of sand. It will only disrupt extant marine ecosystems in the quantity of seawater now occupied by the newest constituent nation of the UK, not elsewhere.
Conclusion
As with Mankiw and Weinzierl 2009’s famous study of optimal height taxation, there are two possible ways to interpret this post. The first is a simple reductio ad absurdum argument against current land use regulations - the planning system means that the British government would receive a greater than 6-fold return from reclaiming an area the size of Wales from the North Sea. The second is that it is a perfectly sensible suggestion similar to existing policies to circumvent NIMBYs in other areas - just as we escape the planning system’s strictures on wind farms by building them offshore, we can do the same for cities. We leave the correct choice as an exercise for the reader.

Cowen’s Second Law!

These estimated costs per unit area are around 100x smaller than the average figure for Singaporean land reclamation - this likely mostly derives from most of the cost in this model coming from the sea wall, which has a price per unit area directly proportional to the square root of project size, so the much smaller scale Singaporean efforts are enormously more costly. Additionally, by employing very expensive sand rather than crushed rock their costs rise further.

Britain is stuck. How can we get it moving again?

Image generated by DALLE-3, prompt: painting of the london skyline, with parents of children very tiny, but the skyline is being constructed with cranes and stuff, abstract
Regulators are easy targets. Before 2009, EU Regulation No. 1677/88 required “Class I cucumbers must not bend more than 10mm per 10cm of length.” Colorado’s child care regulators dictated everything, from handwashing to block-sets (“a minimum of ten blocks per set.”) In Britain, this detailed, prescriptive regulation controls everything, fire-safety to financial services.
Us progress-types pay much attention to zoning laws (which should be scrapped), limits on high-skilled immigration (which should be loosened), or certain tax reforms (which should be implemented). However, “process-based regulation”,  is an often-overlooked cause of Britain’s stagnation. 
Instead, we propose replacing these process-based regulations with outcome-based regulation, and, for some sectors, introducing a Mandatory Insurance Scheme (MIS). Our analysis will focus on three sectors – childcare, energy, housing – where, if implemented, we expect our proposal to most boost British growth.
Outcome-based Regulation
Instead of prescribing a specific process, regulators would instead specify some overall objective, and leave the regulated entity to find the most efficient way to achieve this.
For example, for child-resistant packaging, the CPSC, the US’ consumer safety watchdog, doesn’t specify how to make bottle-caps. Instead, it requires that all manufacturers test any new child-resistant packaging with a sample of four-year-old children, 85% of whom mustn't be able to open the package within five minutes. 
Regulators can achieve regulatory outcomes, while allowing businesses and individuals to decide how. Businesses have many ways to produce their product: regulators with imperfect information will struggle to discern which way is the best. If regulators fine businesses with the social costs of various actions, businesses can optimise accordingly. 
Mandatory Insurance Schemes
One difficulty of simple outcome-based regulation is that, in many industries, regulations are not for definite harms, like dumping chemicals into water sources after usage. Instead, they aim to prevent low-probability, high-downside events, like nursery accidents, nuclear meltdowns, or property fires. 
In these cases, we further propose the adoption of a Mandatory Insurance Scheme. 
In limited cases, we do this already. For example, instead of requiring specific worker-safety standards, British firms must buy workplace injury insurance. If there is an accident, the insurer will pay the workers compensation, and, when necessary, a fine. Mandating insurance means firms will price in the risk, and cannot hide behind limited liability. And ensures victims get compensated. 
This simple change can transform British growth. We’ll now look at three sectors where Britain is stuck and, through implementing our proposal, we can get it moving again.
Childcare
Britain has the second-highest childcare costs in the OECD.1 On average, a two-earner household with two young children will spend one-third of their disposable income on childcare. No wonder fewer than 15% of mothers return to full-time employment five years after giving birth. These costs may be one factor behind lower birth-rates.
Britain’s crippling childcare costs come from UK regulation on staff-to-child ratios. For under-threes, they are the strictest in Europe. If Britain relaxed ratios to Norway’s, this would halve costs, with almost no effects on child safety. One 2015 study shows that this may even increase the quality of childcare, because the nurseries’ fewer staff have increased training. 
While we could (and should!) implement this specific change to staff-to-child ratios, switching to outcome-based regulation would solve this problem, and future ones. Regulators would simply decide the fines and compensation for an accident, and implement a mandatory insurance scheme. Insurers are incentivised to verify safety compliance, and punish unsafe practices. The resulting price decrease might alone increase British birth-rates by 3-4%.2
Nuclear energy
British electricity consumption is set to double by 2050. As global electricity prices have fallen, British electricity prices have doubled in real terms since 2008. Beyond increasing our electricity bills, higher costs have led to significant lost industrial capacity.3 While Britain’s energy sector as a whole needs reform, nuclear power plants are a missed opportunity. They are reliable, safe and environmentally-friendly. Yet the most recent finished British reactor was finished 28 years ago.
This is because British regulation previously only permitted large, pressurised water reactors. These reactors were optimised to keep submarines underwater for as long as possible, not to minimise costs. Hinkley Point C, currently under construction, will likely cost $42bn.
Here, we can see another benefit of our proposal: increasing innovation. Under these changes, if a firm could demonstrate its safety to insurers, it could build a new design.4 This would allow: safer molten-salt reactors that don’t melt-down, thorium reactors that don’t produce weapons-grade plutonium, cheaper highly-scalable small-modular reactors. By allowing firms flexibility, regulators can achieve their desired outcomes – safer nuclear power and greener energy – by allowing for innovation.
Housing
Housing prices across Britain have grown astronomically. Indeed, if inflation since 1971 had matched the rate of house prices increases, a chicken today would cost £82. 26% of median British family income is spent on rent, and 35% in London. 
This is a result of the “Green Belt.” Infamously, this is region around Britain’s most productive cities where regulators have made new development practically impossible, and responsible for much of today’s prices. This zoning, and housing generally, has been the target of specific policy reforms by progress-types for decades (which we support): street votes, deregulation of the green-belt around railway stations, mandatory home-building targets for councils. However, some process-based reforms are vulnerable to motivated adversarial actors, like “NIMBYs”, who can find loopholes in a new process.
Outcome-based regulation changes the incentives, leading to more resilient change. Regulators would simply have to specify desired environmental results and food production, and allow firms to develop accordingly. Following, firms may purchase and provide protection to land elsewhere in the country, achieving desired environmental benefits at the lowest cost.5 Developers would find the most effective solutions.
Implications
This isn’t (only) a list of specific changes to boost British growth: decrease staff-to-child ratios, approve innovative nuclear designs, reform land-use. We highlight a general procedure on how to achieve those changes. Regulators should optimise for the outcome they care about, not dictate the process to achieve this. Whether that be accident-free nurseries, safe nuclear reactors, protected natural beauty, or any regulatory outcome: safer construction, cleaner air, non-toxic medical drugs. 6
We emphasise childcare, electricity and construction because implementing this proposal in these sectors could boost workforce participation and birth-rates, lower energy costs and attract businesses, decrease house prices and increase worker mobility. Those industries neatly illustrate the three, central benefits of outcome-based regulation: cost-effective safety procedures, technological innovation, and resilient policy reforms.
In short, these sectors epitomise why Britain is stuck. Changing burdensome process-based regulations to outcome-based ones can get it moving again. 
Looking forward, the most exciting application of our proposal may be in regulating new, rapidly-evolving technologies, which have massive potential benefits, but also the potential for widespread harm. Think biotechnology, nuclear fusion, artificial intelligence. British regulators today face an impossible dilemma. They must try to regulate an exponentially-changing technology without limiting innovation or scaring away companies, and simultaneously protect public safety, all while lacking resources and technical expertise. 
However, by mandating outcomes and insurance schemes, regulators need not design and redesign standards as technology advances. Instead, regulators can set their desired outcomes - letting developers, and insurers, find the most cost-effective way to achieve and monitor them.7 Only this way might Britain stay moving.

 Figure for a two-earner British household, with two children aged two and three.
2
Childcare costs £14,000/child on average, so the 50% saving below implies £14,000 per child (as maternity leave lasts x months then 30 hours of free childcare per week starts at age 3). A reduction in the present value of childcare costs of $17,800 in Sweden boosted the birth rate by 4-6% (https://docs.iza.org/dp3942.pdf): this represented some 57% of GDP per capita at the time, so the 38% reduction equivalent this represents should boost birth rates by 3-4%.
3
The long-run price elasticity of demand of electricity is -0.3 to -1.1 (https://www.haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/T.-Deryugina.pdf), so UK businesses would use 20-93% more electricity if prices had remained at 2009 levels: a large increase in industrial production.
4
Some projects, like nuclear reactors, may be too big for a single insurer to insure - but fractionalising insurance contracts and selling them to many parties, would allow much larger projects than could otherwise occur by spreading risk. 
5
Parkland is estimated to be worth 61 times more than green belt land by unit area (£54,000 vs £889/acre, https://www.adamsmith.org/research/the-green-noose), so even very small proportions of new development reserved for parkland would be completely sufficient to improve amenities compared to the current situation.
6
To illustrate, clinical trials could also be made more flexible here: firms could sell any medical product which a sufficiently capitalised insurer would agree to back, and payouts would then be issued if the drug resulted in increases in mortality or reductions in quality of life beyond some threshold.
7
Take AI. AI will revolutionise Britain’s economy, but carries significant, societal-scale risks: disinformation, privacy violations, even existential. Today, British regulators are trying to implement a “model evaluations” scheme, whereby they have to design and execute which “tests” models must pass in order to be safe for public deployment – a difficult technical challenge. Instead, under a MIS, after regulators decided certain harms that they’d like to fine companies (such as leaks of model weights, certain dangerous capabilities like hacking), insurers both monitor and incentivise the AI company by adjusting risk premiums depending on the expected riskiness of their actions, internalising the uncertain cost to society before the harm occurs.

","Would insurance help for events that are very rare, and we have little to no past data? also a breakdown would have huge knock on effects that wont just be arbitrated in the court.

This is regarding using insurance for nuclear and AI. It seems specially impossible for the latter, where the direction and capability of tech may change at any time
","1. Yes, you are correct in observing that it is difficult for insurers to calculate the probability of some events, though it's likely to much easier than regulators, who will therefore default to the most restrictive policy. The insurers are incentivised to find the accurate probability for such rare, high-cost event, similarly to how actuaries have good models of other rare, high-cost events, like wars, which we do sell insurance for.

2. Is what you are trying to ask with the ""breakdown"" that a lot more arbitration will be needed? Could you elaborate?

3. For AI, what we were pointing at was that this is a much more flexible regime that would perform better in situations where ""the direction and capability of tech may change at any time"", because the standards/regulation would not have to update to the specific process by which AI is produced, instead focusing on the societally beneficial outcomes (maximising interpretability, preventing accessible bioweapon production etc.) without requiring the technical expertise and speed needed for safety of each of the latest research paradigms.

Assessing altruism
Is intergenerational altruism 0.09?

In the standard Barro-Becker model of fertility, utility u in period t is: ut=ctσ+αnt1−ϵut+1
with c as consumption, alpha as intergenerational altruism, n as the number of children and sigma and epsilon reflecting diminishing marginal returns to material consumption and children respectively. Alexandrie and Eden 2023 find that alpha would need to be 0.09 for a steady state solution i.e. individuals must value the welfare of their first child at merely 9% of their own, given other commonly accepted parameter values.1 This value seems paradoxical considering that the average child's consumption level is far above 9% of their parent's, while under log utility functions under altruism of 0.09 the child’s consumption would be 9% of the parent’s. Indeed, an infant's market consumption could feasibly surpass £100,000 under some definitions given that their demand for attention equates to about four full-time equivalent (FTE) units per year. So, what could possibly account for this discrepancy?
One possible explanation could lie in the scale economies in household production, allowing parents to provide certain services much below market prices. This theory holds water in scenarios like caring for infants, where a parent promising to feed a baby whenever they wake has a much lower utility cost than paying someone else to do so - except for the very wealthiest individuals. However, this doesn't fully elucidate many parental behaviours, such as the allocation of extensive resources towards toys and children-specific activities, where such household-generated economies of scale are non-existent - and it regardless appears that the marginal toy contributes significantly less than 11.1 times the utility than the same consumption would confer to a parent.
Another theory posits that children are utility monsters, an idea that, while unprovable due to its unobservable nature, could hold some merit. Children may exhibit a higher value of nu than the average adult, appearing more content with and attached to a single toy than adults are with comparable levels of wealth. This assertion seems paradoxical, as children have abundant leisure time, and if consumption returns per unit of leisure time diminish, children should have a lower value of nu. The quantification of this distinction would be intriguing, possibly using children’s risk preferences with differing amounts of sweets, although this could be complicated by the potential misunderstanding of probabilities on the children’s part due to internal computational constraints.
Yet another explanation suggests that parents view their children as a prestige good. Accordingly, children partaking in various activities becomes a costly signal, trapping us in an inefficient equilibrium. In this case, a government might - in a way similar to the optimal response if education is primarily signalling - reduce the current subsidies currently allocated to children’s consumption, for example via tax exemptions on many goods primarily intended for children, or could even tax their consumption once all existing net subsidies are removed.

A more plausible answer, perhaps, is that most individuals are not consequentialists—they don’t value the potential utility of a person who could exist but does not as equal to the utility of an existing person. This belief seems quite plausible given typical responses to philosophical questions. Such responses are generally only partially total utilitarian in nature; otherwise, many more beliefs beyond those currently expressed would follow. This would imply that consistent consequentialists would have more children than deontologists, ceteris paribus - which would be fascinating to investigate. 
For two situation, the implied values are even more infeasible at 7.4%. The disparity is also worse even than this because fertility rates in much of the developed world are below steady state.
","Thanks for writing this! Here are some further reflections:

As the paper points out, there is a lot of uncertainty associated with the Barro-Becker model and its parametrization, so one should probably not put too much weight on it. Moreover, the model was designed for the very specific purpose of explaining fertility choices/population growth; I would not necessarily expect it to be a very good model for estimating parent-to-child altruism.

For estimates of the intergenerational altruism parameter, it might be worth looking at is Schwarze and Winkelmann’s 2001-paper ""Happiness and altruism within the extended family"". They estimate that the intergenerational altruism parameter is between 0.04 and 0.25, using survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel.

Another consideration that is worth mentioning is that the intergenerational altruism parameter, as used in the Barro-Becker model, also reflects discounting. The Barro-Becker model is not an overlapping-generations model: the parents live for 25 years and are then replaced by their children, who live to 25 years, etc. Therefore, in the model, parents' only opportunity for being altruistic is to give up some of their own current consumption and save it for the sake of their children's consumption in 25 years. A standard 2% rate of pure time preference on its own implies that utility in 25 years from now is valued at only 60% ≈ 0.98^25 of current utility.

","Thanks for the reflections - I think they should be able to explain the results! Schwarze and Wilkelmann's paper tracks generational transfers after individuals have left their parents' homes: our confusion referred more to the surprisingly high level of consumption of children while they are much younger. If parental altruism fell with children's age then this would offer a way to reconcile the estimates as well: parents choose their number of children based on future utility, but choose consumption of themselves and their children in each year based on utility maximisation in that year. This hypothesis seems plausible as the Barro-Becker parameter you estimate once discounting is included is 0.15, compared to the about 0.085 (averaged over men and women) in their regression with full controls instruments etc: so assuming constant child consumption over their lifetime, 2% discount, 80 years of lifetime of which 20 are childhood this gives a coefficient of 0.25, which once some other effects are accounted for (greater concavity than log, scale economies in households, etc) should give an estimate for the current consumption of children as a fraction of their parents that is not too implausible.

Paying For Peace,"Paying For Peace
How much would Russian soldiers need to be paid to defect if offered EU citizenship?

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused the loss of countless lives, hundreds of billions in damage and about $150bn financial and military aid from allies, primarily the United States and the Europe Union (EU).
One potential idea to end the conflict is to pay Russian soldiers, often unwilling combatants, to surrender. Indeed, the Ukrainian government, shortly after the invasion began, offered Russian soldiers 5 million roubles ($48,000), or four years' salary for the average Russian, to do so. 

More than a year later, the scheme has received very little public attention. At the time, Bryan Caplan, an economist at George Mason University, said the scheme would have limited effect because Russian soldiers considering it had to weigh it against three large costs, namely the risks of: 
Being shot for desertion by the Russian army 
Ukrainian soldiers disobeying international law and shooting any captured prisoners 
Them being returned to Russia in a peace deal where they would most likely face death or imprisonment for defecting.1
Caplan suggests an improvement: offering not only payment but also EU citizenship for Russian soldiers and their families. This means that defecting soldiers and their families can both establish themselves and permanently enjoy an income several times higher than their previous life while facing little risk of forced repatriation. Although this scheme has attracted some interest elsewhere, no attempt has yet been made to model its impact.
In this post, we provide a simple model of the effect of such a policy. Conservatively, we conclude that if there is a <17% chance of death while trying to defect, a $100,000 payment is sufficient to incentivise the average Russian soldier to do so – meaning that it might cost as little as $20bn to end the war entirely.
The Model
We’ll assume a rational choice model for any individual soldier. Therefore, if they receive greater utility from defecting than they do continue to fight, they will do so.
We first compute how much utility soldiers get from continuing to fight. We do this by taking the amount they value living in Russia (after the war) and multiplying that by the probability they survive the war, should they continue fighting, added to a constant term to account for whether they believe in the cause they are fighting for.2 See the equation below.
Ufight=1−D1−bα(log⁡(Yhome)1−r+rlog⁡(ghome)(1−r)2)+B
Then, we compute how much utility soldiers gain from defecting. We adapt the same model, adding a lump-sum payment, adjusting for EU incomes and replacing the probability of death by the probability of being killed during defection and the belief term with the utility cost of moving to a new country to live. See the equation below:3
Udefect=(1−H−T1−bα)(log(Yforeign+L)+rlog⁡(Yforeign)1−r+rlog⁡(gforeign)(1−r)2)−γ
Parameter Estimation
We now estimate the relevant parameters. We'll start with some key values:
Yhome: The per capita income in Russia is $32,862.60. Yforeign: Meanwhile, the highest per capita income (PPP) value in the EU is Luxembourg's at $115,683.49. Since Russians could choose any EU member state, selecting any other country means that they derive a strict increase in utility from their choice, rendering this a lower bound.
r: Based on the research by Matousek, Havranek, and Irsova 2019, the corrected discount rate is found to be between 0.15 and 0.33. We'll use the geometric mean, which gives us a value for 1-r of 0.76.
alpha: The current birth rate per capita in Russia is 0.75, and the alpha value for a steady-state population is 0.09, from Alexandrie and Eden forthcoming.
ghome: PWC predicts global economic growth at 2.7% per year for this decade. We'll assume Russia's growth (ghome) equals this, as its GDP per capita is around the world average. gforeignMeanwhile, average EU growth during the 2010s was 1.58%, which we'll use for the foreign growth rate (gforeign).
In terms of the war-related parameters:
D: Over the past year, Russia has seen around 50,000 deaths in the war from more than 750,000 deployed soldiers. Assuming the war lasts for another 2 years, we'll use a conservative death rate estimate (D) of 0.2.
H: The risks that Ukrainian soldiers shoot those attempting to surrender are rendered minimal by providing financial rewards to Ukrainian soldiers for capturing Russian soldiers.
B: We can estimate the utility of joining the military (B) by examining the large salary increases for potential Russian recruits in mid-2022 and the actual number of soldiers recruited. Despite significant financial incentives (up to 10 times regular military salaries) and reduced wages in other sectors, military recruitment declined after the war began. By comparing the current utility without B assuming a 3-fold increase in wages (41.4 utils) to the utility before B (46.4 utils), we conservatively estimate B at 5.0 utils.4
gamma: Based on a forthcoming study by McClements and Cheang, the cost of relocating is bounded by $62,000 for individuals with slightly above-average global income. This translates to 1.82 utils if consumed immediately, or more if consumed optimally, which it will be here.

Even if the probability of successfully surrendering appears high at 80% with a $1,000,000 payment, it's important to consider that soldiers can choose the timing of their surrender. With many opportunities to surrender, they can perform better than randomly sampling across these chances would suggest.
At a more reasonable payment of $100,000, a combined value of 0.17 for the cost of human lives and the difficulty of surrender (H+T) would be sufficient. This scenario becomes more plausible if the Ukrainian army adapts to make surrendering as easy as possible for Russian soldiers. If all but 200,000 soldiers were to defect under these conditions, the Russian war effort north of Crimea could be all but defeated, costing only $20bn. This is a relatively small price compared to the $150 billion spent on the war so far, with no end in sight.
Estimating The Impact
To estimate the potential gains of the scheme implemented successfully, we can use a modified version of Lancaster's Laws, as presented in Taylor 1981, a set of mathematical models used to describe the relationships between various factors in war, such as force size, attrition rates, and the duration of a conflict.
dxdt=−ax1−WyW
dydt=−by1−WxW
As there is currently insufficient or unreliable data on army sizes over time or casualty figures for individual battles, we make the following assumptions for the purposes of calculating a ballpark guess:
Wounded soldiers are permanently taken out of action.
The Russian army has a constant strength of 500,000, while the Ukrainian army has 700,000 soldiers.
Both armies maintained these numbers throughout the war.
Russia has suffered 200,000 casualties (dead and wounded) to date, while Ukraine has experienced 120,000 casualties.
Russia or Ukraine would each surrender if they suffer over 50% of their current strength as casualties.
Feeding these into a model produces the following results.

Figure 3: Implied Ukrainian casualties before victory by number of daily Russian defections and values of inefficiencies of scale parameter. Interactive version here.

Figure 4: Implied war length in days by number of daily Russian defections and values of inefficiencies of scale parameter. Interactive version here.
Even if there were only several hundred defecting a day, these results imply the war could be shortened by over a year, saving many billions of dollars and tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives.
Possible Variations
If actually implemented, policymakers might want to consider a number of variations to the policy to make this more effective, such as:
Pay higher-ranked or better-trained Russian soldiers more to defect, and to bring their subordinates with them,
Paying Russian soldiers for bringing equipment with them,
Pay Ukrainian soldiers for prisoners they captured to ensure the Hague Conventions are obeyed,
As Caplan initially proposed, offering a higher initial payment to soldiers who initially defect incentivises faster adoption and increases the credibility of the scheme.
Discussion and Conclusion
In the worst case, even if Russia manages to significantly increase surveillance on its troops, maintaining desertion at current levels and closing its borders to prevent the families of defecting soldiers from leaving under the scheme. Despite these countermeasures, both actions would come at a high cost for Russia. Increased surveillance would likely further diminish the already low morale among soldiers while closing the borders would destabilize the existing regime and increase trade costs.
Furthermore, it might at first seem morally unjust that attacking Russian soldiers would be offered EU citizenship when this is not available to Ukrainian soldiers defending their homes. We hope that, if this scheme is implemented, the expedited end of the war opens the door for Ukrainian EU membership, affording all Ukrainians such a right. 
Considering these factors, this scheme represents a highly cost-effective way to gain an advantage in the war if it works as intended. Even in the worst-case scenario, the strategy could still yield considerable benefits without incurring any costs beyond the paper on which the announcement was written.

The 16% probability of a Russia-NATO war by 2050 was predicted by Metaculus users at the beginning of 2022. This analysis assumes the probability doubled uniformly over the period, Russian civilians have a zero probability of death in such a war, and Russia's casualties are proportional to those currently experienced in Ukraine. These assumptions result in a conservative D value before the war of 0.0024.

","Some unaddressed problems:

1. What about the negative effects on the Ukrainian military? It seems like Ukrainian soldiers are making $40k or less. Some might rationally support the plan in order to bring an end to the war, but many would be bitter if their government paid 2.5xtheir annual salary to the enemy. The impact could outweigh the benefit.

1A. Paying bounties to Ukrainians might help the problem above, but could also create a discipline problem on the battlefield with capturing being incentivized over other activities.

2. What about war criminals? Can they defect? If defectors are arrested instead of rewarded that can’t get out or the program won’t work. If war criminals can defect, it might double down on the problem above.

2A. What about mercenaries and the Ukrainian citizens of the occupied territories fighting for Russia? For the former, they might be militarily useless, but Russia would have an awesome recruiting tool to drain money from the EU/Ukraine. For the latter, Ukraine might balk at paying collaborators.

2B. What about the regular criminals fighting for Wagner? Will the EU want to offer cash and citizenship to some rapists and murderers?

And an alternative formulation: what about EU/US temporary work visas with a path to citizenship for military age Russian men (plus immediate family) who can make it out of Russia to present themselves. This drains the manpower pool for the military and economy, forces Russia to overtly prevent citizens from leaving, and sidesteps problem 1, and maybe problem 2.

","Thanks, those are extremely good questions - we're considering creating a follow-up post to investigate those and some other problems raised in the comments further. Our current thoughts on them are below.

If sufficiently severe, 1. and 1A. could be resolved by splitting $1 equally among the Ukrainian forces for every dollar paid out to Russian defectors (or potentially more/less). This doubles the cost of the scheme, but as it is currently extremely cheap in comparison to existing policies doubling would still only make it cost ~$50 billion.

For 2. and 2B., war criminals and individuals convicted of serious crimes (say those that would carry a prison sentence in excess of 10 years) would not be permitted to participate in the scheme: we expect the cost of this (in terms of reduced value generated by the scheme) to be limited as penal battalions are not subject to the stop-loss policy the rest of the Russian military has meaning that they cycle out of the Russian army six months after joining regardless of our scheme and because the roles we care more about defecting - better trained personnel - are much less likely to be in the penal battalions or commit war crimes.

2A could be resolved be having payments as some increasing function of military value, as we note in the post - so DPR/LNR conscripts would likely receive EU citizenship only with no payment, still probably inducing large numbers to defect at low cost for the EU.

We very much agree with the alternative formulation you propose being implemented alongside our scheme to help drain Russia's military production and general economic capabilities - a version of which was proposed (https://www.adamsmith.org/research/let-them-come) by the Adam Smith Institute shortly after the war broke out. In the context of limited public appetite for migration, we believe our scheme is higher impact per migrant so would ideally be implemented first: however, we would very much prefer to see both.

How much would Russian soldiers need to be paid to defect if offered EU citizenship?

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused the loss of countless lives, hundreds of billions in damage and about $150bn financial and military aid from allies, primarily the United States and the Europe Union (EU).
One potential idea to end the conflict is to pay Russian soldiers, often unwilling combatants, to surrender. Indeed, the Ukrainian government, shortly after the invasion began, offered Russian soldiers 5 million roubles ($48,000), or four years' salary for the average Russian, to do so. 

More than a year later, the scheme has received very little public attention. At the time, Bryan Caplan, an economist at George Mason University, said the scheme would have limited effect because Russian soldiers considering it had to weigh it against three large costs, namely the risks of: 
Being shot for desertion by the Russian army 
Ukrainian soldiers disobeying international law and shooting any captured prisoners 
Them being returned to Russia in a peace deal where they would most likely face death or imprisonment for defecting.1
Caplan suggests an improvement: offering not only payment but also EU citizenship for Russian soldiers and their families. This means that defecting soldiers and their families can both establish themselves and permanently enjoy an income several times higher than their previous life while facing little risk of forced repatriation. Although this scheme has attracted some interest elsewhere, no attempt has yet been made to model its impact.
In this post, we provide a simple model of the effect of such a policy. Conservatively, we conclude that if there is a <17% chance of death while trying to defect, a $100,000 payment is sufficient to incentivise the average Russian soldier to do so – meaning that it might cost as little as $20bn to end the war entirely.
The Model
We’ll assume a rational choice model for any individual soldier. Therefore, if they receive greater utility from defecting than they do continue to fight, they will do so.
We first compute how much utility soldiers get from continuing to fight. We do this by taking the amount they value living in Russia (after the war) and multiplying that by the probability they survive the war, should they continue fighting, added to a constant term to account for whether they believe in the cause they are fighting for.2 See the equation below.
Ufight=1−D1−bα(log⁡(Yhome)1−r+rlog⁡(ghome)(1−r)2)+B
Then, we compute how much utility soldiers gain from defecting. We adapt the same model, adding a lump-sum payment, adjusting for EU incomes and replacing the probability of death by the probability of being killed during defection and the belief term with the utility cost of moving to a new country to live. See the equation below:3
Udefect=(1−H−T1−bα)(log(Yforeign+L)+rlog⁡(Yforeign)1−r+rlog⁡(gforeign)(1−r)2)−γ
Parameter Estimation
We now estimate the relevant parameters. We'll start with some key values:
Yhome: The per capita income in Russia is $32,862.60. Yforeign: Meanwhile, the highest per capita income (PPP) value in the EU is Luxembourg's at $115,683.49. Since Russians could choose any EU member state, selecting any other country means that they derive a strict increase in utility from their choice, rendering this a lower bound.
r: Based on the research by Matousek, Havranek, and Irsova 2019, the corrected discount rate is found to be between 0.15 and 0.33. We'll use the geometric mean, which gives us a value for 1-r of 0.76.
alpha: The current birth rate per capita in Russia is 0.75, and the alpha value for a steady-state population is 0.09, from Alexandrie and Eden forthcoming.
ghome: PWC predicts global economic growth at 2.7% per year for this decade. We'll assume Russia's growth (ghome) equals this, as its GDP per capita is around the world average. gforeignMeanwhile, average EU growth during the 2010s was 1.58%, which we'll use for the foreign growth rate (gforeign).
In terms of the war-related parameters:
D: Over the past year, Russia has seen around 50,000 deaths in the war from more than 750,000 deployed soldiers. Assuming the war lasts for another 2 years, we'll use a conservative death rate estimate (D) of 0.2.
H: The risks that Ukrainian soldiers shoot those attempting to surrender are rendered minimal by providing financial rewards to Ukrainian soldiers for capturing Russian soldiers.
B: We can estimate the utility of joining the military (B) by examining the large salary increases for potential Russian recruits in mid-2022 and the actual number of soldiers recruited. Despite significant financial incentives (up to 10 times regular military salaries) and reduced wages in other sectors, military recruitment declined after the war began. By comparing the current utility without B assuming a 3-fold increase in wages (41.4 utils) to the utility before B (46.4 utils), we conservatively estimate B at 5.0 utils.4
gamma: Based on a forthcoming study by McClements and Cheang, the cost of relocating is bounded by $62,000 for individuals with slightly above-average global income. This translates to 1.82 utils if consumed immediately, or more if consumed optimally, which it will be here.

","Using per capita PPP GDP doesn't make too much sense. Better would be median income at PPP.

It is another question whether the resettled Russians could make it to the median income level, and surely that is not independent of destination country, but that is a harder fix. Still, I might attempt to add a parameter accounting for that and then estimate a value.

","Thanks, those are good points. The first shouldn’t mean the results substantially underestimate the actual payments needed unless Russia is much more equal than the EU: as the EU’s Gini coefficient is 0.301 but Russia’s is 0.36, this suggests this effect could actually mean that a lower payment is needed than the results imply. The second point does imply the Russians would need to pay some training costs to raise their incomes to this level, possibly entirely erasing the gains from first effect.

","You should use EU-wide income if you are using an EU-wide Gini.

I wouldn't have complained so much if you hadn't picked Luxembourg, which is probably the EU country where per-capita GDP is the least informative. (Looking it up, Luxembourg's Gini coefficient is 64.6.)

","Yes you are completely correct, apologies. If I change the income values to those in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_income, then the result changes to https://rpubs.com/Test509/1022056: slightly worse at lower payments but actually better at higher payments due to reducing both Russian and Luxembourger average income rendering larger payments more effective.

The reasons for using Luxembourger income (Russians have a choice of any EU state, if they pick another the utility from doing so must be strictly greater rendering this estimate conservative) still apply.

","In terms of full implementation of this kind of policy, no: in terms of partial, you can view the Hague convention's rules on the treatment of PoWs as part of this. It is usually in the self-interest of belligerents to treat PoWs well to promote as much surrender as possible: during WW2 something like 2.7 million Germans were captured on the Western front from mid-1944 to 1945 compared to about the same number over the entire course of the war in the East, in large part due to the UK and US having much better conditions for prisoners of war. This scheme could thus be viewed as a logical extension of the Hague convention given the large increase in wealth that has occurred since it was signed over a hundred years ago.

B: We can estimate the utility of joining the military (B) by examining the large salary increases for potential Russian recruits in mid-2022 and the actual number of soldiers recruited.

The Results

Figure 1: Payment required by defection failure probability, log scale.
Even if the probability of successfully surrendering appears high at 80% with a $1,000,000 payment, it's important to consider that soldiers can choose the timing of their surrender. With many opportunities to surrender, they can perform better than randomly sampling across these chances would suggest.
At a more reasonable payment of $100,000, a combined value of 0.17 for the cost of human lives and the difficulty of surrender (H+T) would be sufficient. This scenario becomes more plausible if the Ukrainian army adapts to make surrendering as easy as possible for Russian soldiers. If all but 200,000 soldiers were to defect under these conditions, the Russian war effort north of Crimea could be all but defeated, costing only $20bn. This is a relatively small price compared to the $150 billion spent on the war so far, with no end in sight.
Estimating The Impact
To estimate the potential gains of the scheme implemented successfully, we can use a modified version of Lancaster's Laws, as presented in Taylor 1981, a set of mathematical models used to describe the relationships between various factors in war, such as force size, attrition rates, and the duration of a conflict.

As there is currently insufficient or unreliable data on army sizes over time or casualty figures for individual battles, we make the following assumptions for the purposes of calculating a ballpark guess:
Wounded soldiers are permanently taken out of action.
The Russian army has a constant strength of 500,000, while the Ukrainian army has 700,000 soldiers.
Both armies maintained these numbers throughout the war.
Russia has suffered 200,000 casualties (dead and wounded) to date, while Ukraine has experienced 120,000 casualties.
Russia or Ukraine would each surrender if they suffer over 50% of their current strength as casualties.
Feeding these into a model produces the following results.

Figure 3: Implied Ukrainian casualties before victory by number of daily Russian defections and values of inefficiencies of scale parameter. Interactive version here.

Figure 4: Implied war length in days by number of daily Russian defections and values of inefficiencies of scale parameter. Interactive version here.
Even if there were only several hundred defecting a day, these results imply the war could be shortened by over a year, saving many billions of dollars and tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives.
Possible Variations
If actually implemented, policymakers might want to consider a number of variations to the policy to make this more effective, such as:
Pay higher-ranked or better-trained Russian soldiers more to defect, and to bring their subordinates with them,
Paying Russian soldiers for bringing equipment with them,
Pay Ukrainian soldiers for prisoners they captured to ensure the Hague Conventions are obeyed,
As Caplan initially proposed, offering a higher initial payment to soldiers who initially defect incentivises faster adoption and increases the credibility of the scheme.
Discussion and Conclusion
In the worst case, even if Russia manages to significantly increase surveillance on its troops, maintaining desertion at current levels and closing its borders to prevent the families of defecting soldiers from leaving under the scheme. Despite these countermeasures, both actions would come at a high cost for Russia. Increased surveillance would likely further diminish the already low morale among soldiers while closing the borders would destabilize the existing regime and increase trade costs.
Furthermore, it might at first seem morally unjust that attacking Russian soldiers would be offered EU citizenship when this is not available to Ukrainian soldiers defending their homes. We hope that, if this scheme is implemented, the expedited end of the war opens the door for Ukrainian EU membership, affording all Ukrainians such a right. 
Considering these factors, this scheme represents a highly cost-effective way to gain an advantage in the war if it works as intended. Even in the worst-case scenario, the strategy could still yield considerable benefits without incurring any costs beyond the paper on which the announcement was written.

The 16% probability of a Russia-NATO war by 2050 was predicted by Metaculus users at the beginning of 2022. This analysis assumes the probability doubled uniformly over the period, Russian civilians have a zero probability of death in such a war, and Russia's casualties are proportional to those currently experienced in Ukraine. These assumptions result in a conservative D value before the war of 0.0024.

","If I were russia I'd just kill the families of people who defect. Easy-peasy. how do you model that?

","In terms of modelling were this to occur: The evidence cited in the post suggests people value their children’s utility as 9% of their own: assuming such a ratio holds then the fraction of utility that people would value the death of their immediate family (siblings + parents + children) as under average Russian family sizes is going to be ~<50% of their own utility (summing average birth rate today + highest average birth rate in past 60 years + 2 parents. Assumes all family alive, have already had all children, siblings had in highest birth rate year etc.). If this is put into the model you get that a $100,000 payment would still be sufficient (https://rpubs.com/Test509/1021826) to induce defection with the chance of being unsuccessful just below 10%.

In terms of plausibility of it actually occurring: Putin likely lacks the legitimacy to murder tens of thousands of innocent Russian civilians, as the long delays in mobilisation show. Even if Russia could credibly threaten to do this in the first say 1000 cases, the result would just likely be that individuals who cared little for their families would take advantage of the scheme, vast amounts of political capital would be spent on killing the families of those first defectors, and then if the scheme is axed afterwards then the scenario originally described in the blog post above occurs.

","I don't think Putin would murder the families but if this scheme were launched at large scale, he would probably find ways to imprison them/take the children away from the family (like this case https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-father-whose-daughter-drew-anti-war-picture-given-two-years-jail-2023-03-28/). And there's a difference between statistical valuation of a small risk or valuation of a small change in utility and the value you assign to a near-certain loss of a spouse's freedom/children being taken away from you. There may be some irrationality too. I know lots of Russians who emigrated to the US, and many of them at least claim to be afraid to speak up against the war publicly out of fear that Putin will do something to their families in Russia (which is quite implausible given that I'm not thinking of publicly prominent individuals here).

","Some irrationality is possible but the same logic as I gave in the second paragraph of my reply above likely holds: if Putin can credibly promise to imprison only 10,000 innocent family members (equivalent to considerably fewer soldiers), Russians with the least ties to family defect first, Putin runs out of political capital and then everyone else can follow. This would slow the rate at which the scheme progresses (and thus cause more Ukrainian casualties relative to the counterfactual) but would likely not change the eventual outcome.

Paying For Peace,"Paying For Peace
How much would Russian soldiers need to be paid to defect if offered EU citizenship?

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused the loss of countless lives, hundreds of billions in damage and about $150bn financial and military aid from allies, primarily the United States and the Europe Union (EU).
One potential idea to end the conflict is to pay Russian soldiers, often unwilling combatants, to surrender. Indeed, the Ukrainian government, shortly after the invasion began, offered Russian soldiers 5 million roubles ($48,000), or four years' salary for the average Russian, to do so. 

More than a year later, the scheme has received very little public attention. At the time, Bryan Caplan, an economist at George Mason University, said the scheme would have limited effect because Russian soldiers considering it had to weigh it against three large costs, namely the risks of: 
Being shot for desertion by the Russian army 
Ukrainian soldiers disobeying international law and shooting any captured prisoners 
Them being returned to Russia in a peace deal where they would most likely face death or imprisonment for defecting.1
Caplan suggests an improvement: offering not only payment but also EU citizenship for Russian soldiers and their families. This means that defecting soldiers and their families can both establish themselves and permanently enjoy an income several times higher than their previous life while facing little risk of forced repatriation. Although this scheme has attracted some interest elsewhere, no attempt has yet been made to model its impact.
In this post, we provide a simple model of the effect of such a policy. Conservatively, we conclude that if there is a <17% chance of death while trying to defect, a $100,000 payment is sufficient to incentivise the average Russian soldier to do so – meaning that it might cost as little as $20bn to end the war entirely.
The Model
We’ll assume a rational choice model for any individual soldier. Therefore, if they receive greater utility from defecting than they do continue to fight, they will do so.
We first compute how much utility soldiers get from continuing to fight. We do this by taking the amount they value living in Russia (after the war) and multiplying that by the probability they survive the war, should they continue fighting, added to a constant term to account for whether they believe in the cause they are fighting for.2 See the equation below.
Ufight=1−D1−bα(log⁡(Yhome)1−r+rlog⁡(ghome)(1−r)2)+B
Then, we compute how much utility soldiers gain from defecting. We adapt the same model, adding a lump-sum payment, adjusting for EU incomes and replacing the probability of death by the probability of being killed during defection and the belief term with the utility cost of moving to a new country to live. See the equation below:3
Udefect=(1−H−T1−bα)(log(Yforeign+L)+rlog⁡(Yforeign)1−r+rlog⁡(gforeign)(1−r)2)−γ
Parameter Estimation
We now estimate the relevant parameters. We'll start with some key values:
Yhome: The per capita income in Russia is $32,862.60. Yforeign: Meanwhile, the highest per capita income (PPP) value in the EU is Luxembourg's at $115,683.49. Since Russians could choose any EU member state, selecting any other country means that they derive a strict increase in utility from their choice, rendering this a lower bound.
r: Based on the research by Matousek, Havranek, and Irsova 2019, the corrected discount rate is found to be between 0.15 and 0.33. We'll use the geometric mean, which gives us a value for 1-r of 0.76.
alpha: The current birth rate per capita in Russia is 0.75, and the alpha value for a steady-state population is 0.09, from Alexandrie and Eden forthcoming.
ghome: PWC predicts global economic growth at 2.7% per year for this decade. We'll assume Russia's growth (ghome) equals this, as its GDP per capita is around the world average. gforeignMeanwhile, average EU growth during the 2010s was 1.58%, which we'll use for the foreign growth rate (gforeign).

H: The risks that Ukrainian soldiers shoot those attempting to surrender are rendered minimal by providing financial rewards to Ukrainian soldiers for capturing Russian soldiers.
B: We can estimate the utility of joining the military (B) by examining the large salary increases for potential Russian recruits in mid-2022 and the actual number of soldiers recruited. Despite significant financial incentives (up to 10 times regular military salaries) and reduced wages in other sectors, military recruitment declined after the war began. By comparing the current utility without B assuming a 3-fold increase in wages (41.4 utils) to the utility before B (46.4 utils), we conservatively estimate B at 5.0 utils.4

","You title the post, ""Paying for Peace."" But we should *not* be ""paying for peace"". We should be paying for *justice.*

*Justice* would involve Vladimir Putin being arrested and tried for the crimes for which he has been indicted.
","It seems likely that if the goal is removing Putin from power but keeping him alive to try in court then destabilizing his regime by defeating him on the battlefield is one of the best ways of doing that: and with that in mind, as demand curves slope downwards, we should investigate the cheapest way of doing that to the West to ensure the maximum probability it does in fact occur. The post above provides indicative evidence it is possible to defeat Putin at a much lower cost than existing policies, so it may be profitable to research the scheme further.

","""It seems likely that if the goal is removing Putin from power but keeping him alive to try in court then destabilizing his regime by defeating him on the battlefield is one of the best ways of doing that:...""

The problem is that the Russian military doesn't want to be defeated on the battlefield. In my proposed plan, they're not defeated. In my plan, all that they do is to arrest one man, Putin, extradite him to the International Criminal Court, and aid in setting up a democracy in their country.

If we pay soldiers to defect, the soldiers that remain will likely get slaughtered on the battlefield. And the defectors may end up with many members of their family killed, and there is a high likelihood that they'd never be able to return to Russia.

If, on the other hand, if we pay the whole military, not only would their families likely be safe, and they'd likely be able to stay in Russia, they could even end up being praised by their fellow citizens for helping to set up a democracy.
","The ability of low-ranking officers to engineer a coup without higher level support feels limited: in principle your proposed scheme and ours are fully compatable if you were to offer large payments to any individuals responsible for a coup were it to be carried out (expecting senior officers to do so) but to further incentivise a coup occurring you continued to undermine Russia's military capabilities using the cheapest available methods, which the post above has demonstrated may be paying other soldiers to defect.

Offering payments to the entire Russian army regardless of their part in any coup feels extremely wastleful however: most of the money would go to paying individuals who did not contribute at all to the coup, meaning much better results could be achieved at lower cost by offering larger payments to up to say 1000 officers actually involved in the coup in question.

","If you offered this deal to Ukrainian conscripts they would probably take it too.

I don't think anyone wants to learn under what circumstances their slave armies would stop fighting.
","Ukrainian soldiers contemplating a similar deal offered by Russia would face the following drawbacks:

Russian citizenship is less valuable than that of the EU (which they would likely attain if they win the war).

Russia has much less credibility to honour any promises made regarding payments or treatment due to lacking the rule of law.

Russia is lower income than the EU and US so could likely afford only a lower lump sum payment.

Thus, as Caplan originally noted, introducing this scheme to conflicts seems very much asymmetrical - and advantageous to the West.

Prisons Compared,"Prisons compared
How do prison sentences compare with alternatives that are neither incapacitative nor criminogenic at different costs of crime?

Prisons could have four possible effects on crime: deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation and criminogenic. These are, respectively, that they could dissuade potential criminals from committing crimes by raising the costs of doing so; they could keep away from the public individuals who otherwise would commit crimes in some period of time; they could reform criminals and allow them to reintegrate into society, reducing the incentive for them to commit crimes; or they could encourage criminality among everyone in prison by ensuring that the bulk of individuals the marginal prisoner associated with were criminals. They achieve these four effects at an extremely high cost: £48,000 per prisoner-year in the UK and rising rapidly (average 6.4% per year over the past 5 years).
For the purposes of this blog post, they will be compared to a system with equal deterrence, no incapacitation, no rehabilitation and no criminogenic component and no financial cost excess of court and policing expenses. The no incapacitation assumption is highly conservative due to the low costs and high incapacitation potential of employing say electronic tagging coupled with a curfew for convicted individuals, and the no rehabilitation component would also likely be highly conservative due to the likely public desire for governments to provide such a service. A criminal justice system with zero financial costs beyond the courts and police could be achieved by a massive expansion of community service to allow prisoners to replace existing workers employed by the government for some tasks such as removing litter, plausibly even saving funds on net, or by similar means. The no criminogenic aspect simply relies on the proposed alternative system not forcing individuals convicted of previous offences to live with each other and only each other for years on end, and seems highly plausible. Equal deterrence seems very easy to achieve by frontloading costs, as criminals have much higher discount rates than the already astonishing 20-35% for the general population.1
Cullen, Jonson and Nagin (2011) reviewed several studies on the effect of prisons on recidivism, with the criminogenic effect dominating the rehabilitative effect. Of the meta-analyses which provided the quantitative estimates necessary for this model, Gendreau, Goggin, Cullen, and Andrews (2000) found a 7% increase; Smith, Goggin, and Gendreau (2002) found an 8% increase, rising to 11% on the highest quality studies; and Jonson (2010) found a 14% increase, falling to 5% on the highest quality studies. An 8.7% effect size will be used here. Implicitly this blog post’s methodology ignores the large numbers of crimes committed within prison or not reported, rendering the benefit estimate conservative. Canada provides a breakdown of recidivism rates by age at release for the 2007-2012 period, which will be used here to estimate total costs of crime over a lifetime for someone convicted of a crime at a given age by punishment system.2

The resultant cost ratios for a 20-year-old can be seen above.3 The alternative system is better for all crimes and crime costs excluding the very highest sentences for the most costly of crimes - indeed, if interpretted literally the results above imply that only murderers would optimally go to prison as very few crimes even have costs of the minimum $500,000 modelled, let alone the near $10,000,000 required for prison sentences to be better than the alternative.
This method does however have a number of shortcomings. By using data for the average prisoner, this result does not imply the replacement of prison for all offenders, and as recidivism rates may vary by crime does not even necessarily imply that prison is worse than the alternative above for the majority of people in prison for every crime. Additionally, some would argue that the suffering of those who have harmed others is inherently good, which if prisons were worse than the conditions in the alternative could mean that those who held such a belief would place a higher value on prisons relative to the alternatives than the results above. Finally, individuals can commit more than one type of crime over their lifetimes, while the model above only allows individuals to commit crimes of a single cost, albeit permitting them to do so multiple times. This may be problematic because the government could today use the fact that individuals are committing more minor crimes today as a signal that more severe ones will be committted in future, reducing total crime costs, although to the extent that this is a boost in the reoffending rate following crimes this effect will boost both costs and thus have only a small effect on optimal behaviour. These shortcomings will be addressed in a future post.

This observation also predicts that variation of prison sentences for most crimes on the margin should have essentially no effect on criminal behaviour - one borne out empirically.

Individuals will differ by age at release on many unobservable factors uncontrolled for here.

Older individuals both have lower benefits from prison due to increased likelihood to overrun their sentences beyond the age at which committing crimes is feasible but also lower costs due to having fewer years of life remaining to commit crimes in meaning that the criminogenic effect is of lower cost.

I am not sure this follows directly. You could have a case where:

- A crime costs $5k

- Imprisoning the criminal costs $500k

- If you didn't imprison the criminal, more crimes would happen.

The problem here is that you don't really see the crimes that don't happen. Yeah there are a few natural experiments, but they look at short-term changes, whereass on the whole I expect long-term incentives around how viable a life-strategy is to basicaly dominate.

","I agree: it doesn't necessarily follow because the model only allows an individual to have the potential to commit one type of crime in their lifetime, so unsurprisingly finds that individuals only assigned the ability to commit low-cost crimes shouldn't be imprisoned. What it does seem to show though is that there does need to be a perceived very high probability an individual will commit at least one murder in the future to justify such imprisonment compared to a system with equal deterrent capabilities without the criminogenic effects.

I agree in the long run viability will dominate, but as economic lifestyle viability will be determined by probability of being able to complete crimes successfully not by harshness of (non-financial) punishment in the event of capture and crime does appear to have roughly unitary elasticity with law enforcement expenditure this would still imply cutting prison expenditure and raising funding for law enforcement agencies on the margin if the goal was crime minimisation?

Prisons Compared,"Prisons compared
How do prison sentences compare with alternatives that are neither incapacitative nor criminogenic at different costs of crime?

Prisons could have four possible effects on crime: deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation and criminogenic. These are, respectively, that they could dissuade potential criminals from committing crimes by raising the costs of doing so; they could keep away from the public individuals who otherwise would commit crimes in some period of time; they could reform criminals and allow them to reintegrate into society, reducing the incentive for them to commit crimes; or they could encourage criminality among everyone in prison by ensuring that the bulk of individuals the marginal prisoner associated with were criminals. They achieve these four effects at an extremely high cost: £48,000 per prisoner-year in the UK and rising rapidly (average 6.4% per year over the past 5 years).
For the purposes of this blog post, they will be compared to a system with equal deterrence, no incapacitation, no rehabilitation and no criminogenic component and no financial cost excess of court and policing expenses. The no incapacitation assumption is highly conservative due to the low costs and high incapacitation potential of employing say electronic tagging coupled with a curfew for convicted individuals, and the no rehabilitation component would also likely be highly conservative due to the likely public desire for governments to provide such a service. A criminal justice system with zero financial costs beyond the courts and police could be achieved by a massive expansion of community service to allow prisoners to replace existing workers employed by the government for some tasks such as removing litter, plausibly even saving funds on net, or by similar means. The no criminogenic aspect simply relies on the proposed alternative system not forcing individuals convicted of previous offences to live with each other and only each other for years on end, and seems highly plausible. Equal deterrence seems very easy to achieve by frontloading costs, as criminals have much higher discount rates than the already astonishing 20-35% for the general population.1

","You also give a few pointers to the academic literature on this topic. I have the nagging doubt that I probably can't trust it, that it's politically biased, that it contradicts some of my strong priors, and that it neglects long-term effects (as in the previous comment). I've never really engaged critically with that nagging doubt, but I thought I'd put it out there.

","These concerns are understandable, but if my net criminogenic effect of +8.7% assumption above is weakened to a 0% assumption prison still shouldn't be used for crimes with a cost below $6 million at cost costs of imprisonment (and this is ignoring other losses from these individuals not working). Ratios: https://rpubs.com/Test509/1002245 Net benefit: https://rpubs.com/Test509/1002246 - so current prison being excessive appears robust to very strong biases in the literature. If you have an effect size you believe to be the case I'm happy to provide the corresponding graphs.
